<div class="chapter">
<h2>PREFACE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author is aware that he is dipping his net into a stream
already darkened by too much ink. The fact that there are so
many books on the religion of Abraham Lincoln is a chief
reason why there should be one more. Books on this subject
are largely polemic works which followed the publication of
Holland's biography in 1865, and multiplied in the controversies
growing out of that and the Lamon and Herndon
biographies in 1872 and 1889 respectively. Within that period
and until the death of Mr. Herndon in 1892 and the publication
of his revised biography of Lincoln in 1893, there was little
opportunity for a work on this subject that was not distinctively
controversial. The time has come for a more dispassionate
view. Of the large number of other books dealing
with this topic, nearly or quite all had their origin in patriotic
or religious addresses, which, meeting with favor when orally
delivered, were more or less superficially revised and printed,
in most instances for audiences not greatly larger than those
that heard them spoken. Many of these are excellent little
books, though making no pretense of original and thorough
investigation.</p>

<p>Of larger and more comprehensive works there are a few,
but they do not attempt the difficult and necessary task of
critical analysis.</p>

<p>So much has been said, and much of it with such intensity
of feeling, on the subject of Lincoln's religion, that a number
of the more important biographies, including the great
work of Nicolay and Hay, say as little on the subject as
possible.</p>

<p>The author of this volume brings no sweeping criticism
against those who have preceded him in the same field. He
has eagerly sought out the books and speeches of all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
within his reach, and is indebted to many of them for valuable
suggestions. A Bibliography at the end of this volume contains
a list of those to whom the author knows himself to be
chiefly indebted, but his obligation goes much farther than
he can hope to acknowledge in print. With all due regard for
these earlier authors, the present writer justifies himself in
the publication of this volume by the following considerations,
which seems to him to differ in important respects from earlier
works in the same field:</p>

<p>(1) He has made an effort to provide an adequate historical
background for the study of the religious life of Abraham
Lincoln in the successive periods of his life; and without
immediately going too deeply into the material of the main
subject, to relate the man to his environment. In this the
author has been aided not only by books and interviews with
men who knew Lincoln, but by some years of personal experience
in communities where the social, educational, and religious
conditions were in all essential respects similar to those in
which Mr. Lincoln lived during two important epochs of his
career. The author was not born in this environment, but he
spent seven years of his youth and young manhood as a
teacher and preacher in a region which give him somewhat
exceptional opportunities for a discriminating judgment.</p>

<p>(2) The author has assembled what is, so far as he knows,
all the essential evidence that has appeared in print concerning
the religious life and opinions of Mr. Lincoln, a larger body,
as he believes, than any previous writer has compiled. He has
added to this all evidence available to him from written and
personal testimony.</p>

<p>He has subjected this evidence to a critical analysis, in an
effort to determine the degree of credibility with which its
several portions may reasonably be received. The author is
not unaware that this is the most disputable, as it is the most
difficult part of his task, and, as he believes, the most valuable
part of it. Unless some such analysis is made, the evidence
resolves itself into chaos.</p>

<p>(3) Several entirely new avenues of investigation have
been opened and lines of evidence adduced which find no place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
in any previous book on Mr. Lincoln's religious life, and very
scant reference, and that without investigation, in one or two
of the biographies.</p>

<p>(4) The book also contains a constructive argument, setting
forth the conviction to which the author has come with
regard to the faith of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible that some readers will find themselves
in essential agreement with the author in the earlier parts
of the book, but will dissent in whole or in part from his own
inferences. Whether the reader agrees or disagrees with the
author in his conclusions, he will find in this book some
material not elsewhere available for the formation of an independent
judgment. Nevertheless the author counts himself
justified not only in adducing the evidence but in stating
frankly the conclusion which to his mind this evidence supports.</p>

<p>This book treats of the religion of Abraham Lincoln; but
it does not consider his religion as wholly expressed in his
theological opinions. Important as it is that a man should
think correctly on all subjects, and especially on a subject of
such transcendent value, religion is more than a matter of
opinion. We cannot adequately consider religion apart from
life. Abraham Lincoln's life was an evolution, and so was
his religion. In a way which this volume will seek to set
forth, Lincoln was himself a believer in evolution, and his
life and religion were in accord with this process as he held it.</p>

<p>This book is, therefore, more than an essay on the religion
of Lincoln, unless religion be understood as inclusive of all
that is normal in life. It deals, therefore, with the life, as
well as with the opinions, of Lincoln; and it considers both
life and opinion as in process of development in each of the
successive stages of his career.</p>

<p>In this respect the present book may claim some distinctive
place in the literature of this subject. Other books have drawn
sharp contrasts between the supposed religious opinions of
Lincoln's youth and those which he is believed to have cherished
later. This book undertakes what may be termed a study
of the evolution of the spiritual life of Abraham Lincoln.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
The author is not aware that this has been done before in
quite this way.</p>

<p>The author acknowledges his obligations to many friends
for their assistance in the preparation of this volume. Mr.
Jesse W. Weik, of Greencastle, Indiana, associate of Mr.
Herndon in the preparation of his Life of Lincoln, and owner
of the Herndon manuscripts, has been generous to me. Mrs.
Clark E. Carr, of Galesburg, Illinois, widow of my honored
friend, and the friend of Lincoln, Colonel Carr, author of
"Lincoln at Gettysburg," has placed at my disposal all her
husband's books and papers. Mr. Judd Stewart, of New York
City, owner of one of the largest collections of Lincolniana,
has assisted me. President John W. Cook of the Northern
Illinois State Normal School has suggested important lines of
research. Mr. John E. Burton, of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,
whose collection of Lincoln books was once the largest in
America, has sold me some of his chief treasures, and imparted
to me much of the fruit of his experience. Mr. O. H. Oldroyd,
of Washington, owner of the famous Lincoln Collection, and
custodian of the house where Lincoln died, has, on two visits,
placed all that he has within my reach. To these, and to a
considerable number of men and women who knew Lincoln
while he was yet living, and to many others whom I cannot
name, my thanks are due.</p>

<p>I regret that one great collection, consisting, however, more
largely of relics than of manuscripts, is so largely packed away
that it has not been of much use to me. Mr. Charles F.
Gunther of Chicago has, however, produced for me such
Lincoln material as seemed to him to bear upon my quest,
and I acknowledge his courtesy.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver P. Barrett of Chicago has given me great joy
in the examination of his fine collection of Lincoln manuscripts.</p>

<p>I have spent a few pleasant and profitable hours in the collection
of Honorable Daniel Fish, the noted Lincoln bibliographer,
of Minneapolis, and thank him for his friendly interest
in this undertaking.</p>

<p>Among libraries, my largest debt is to those of the Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
Historical Society, the Illinois State Historical Society at
Springfield, and the Library of Congress in Washington. In
each of these I have had not only unrestricted access to the
whole Lincoln material possessed by them, but the most generous
and courteous assistance. I have examined every rare
Lincoln book, and many manuscripts, in these three collections.
I have had occasion also to use the Chicago Public Library,
the Newberry Library, and the Library of the University of
Chicago, as well as those of Chicago Theological Seminary
and McCormick Theological Seminary. In certain important
local matters, I have been assisted by the libraries of Knox
College, Galesburg, Illinois, Illinois College, Jacksonville,
Illinois, the Public Library of Peoria, Illinois, and the library
of Transylvania University at Lexington, Kentucky. I also
visited the Public Library of Louisville, with its historical
collections, but most that I found there I had already consulted
elsewhere. The New York Public Library and the
Library of Columbia University supplemented my research at
a few important points. The Oak Park Public Library has
been constantly at my service. The Library of Berea College,
Kentucky, has given me very valuable assistance in finding for
me a large amount of periodical literature bearing on my study.
The five great Boston libraries would have yielded me much
had I come to them earlier. While the book was undergoing
revision, I visited the Athenaeum, the Massachusetts State,
the Boston Public, the Massachusetts Historical, and the Harvard
University libraries. It was gratifying to discover that
even in the last named of these, enriched as it is with the collections
of Charles Sumner, Thomas Wentworth Higginson,
and the Lincoln collection of my friend Alonzo Rothschild,
author of "Lincoln, Master of Men," there was practically
nothing relating to this subject which I had not already seen
and examined. In the Massachusetts Historical Library, however,
I discovered some manuscripts, and that quite unexpectedly,
which afford me much aid in a collateral study.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, I have my own Lincoln
library, which, while a working collection rather than one of
incunabula, and modest in size as compared with some that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
I have used, is still not small. The Bibliography at the end of
the volume is virtually a catalogue of my own Lincoln books.</p>

<p>Claims of completeness are dangerous, and I make none.
But I have been diligent in pursuit of all probable sources of
knowledge of this subject, and I do not now know where
to look for any other book of manuscript that would greatly
alter or add to the material which this book contains. I am
glad, therefore, at this stage, to share the fruits of my investigations
with the reader.</p>

ENVIRONMENTS</p></div>


<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="c">THE CONFLICT OF TESTIMONY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> no other American have so many biographies been written
as of Abraham Lincoln. No other question concerning his life
has evoked more interest than that of his religious faith and
experience. What Abraham Lincoln believed has been told by
many who knew him and whose varied relations to him during
his lifetime rendered it not unreasonable to suppose that they
could give some assured answer to the question of his belief.
The answers are not only varied, but hopelessly contradictory.
It is stated on apparently good authority that in his young
manhood he read Volney's <i>Ruins</i> and Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i>,
and it is affirmed that he accepted their conclusions, and himself
wrote what might have been a book or pamphlet denying
the essential doctrines of the Christian faith as he understood
them. Friends of his who knew him well enough to forbid
the throwing of their testimony out of court have affirmed that
he continued to hold these convictions; and that, while he became
more cautious in the matter of their expression, he carried
them through life and that they never underwent any
radical change. On the other hand, there are declarations,
made by those who also knew Lincoln well, that these views
became modified essentially, and that Lincoln accepted practically
the whole content of orthodox Christian theology as it
was then understood; that he observed daily family worship in
his home; that he carried a Bible habitually upon his person;
and that he was in short in every essential a professed Christian,
though never a member of a Christian church.</p>

<p>There is more than a conflict of testimony; there is posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>tive
chaos. Every recent biographer has felt the inherent difficulties
involved in it. One or two of them have passed it over
with practically no mention; others have become fierce partisans
of the one extreme or the other.</p>

<p>Besides the formal biographies, a literature of this special
topic has grown up. Entire books and many pamphlets and
magazine articles have been written on this one question. The
Chicago Historical Society and the Chicago Public Library
have each devoted a principal division in the Lincoln material
to the literature relating to his religion. It has been the
writer's privilege to examine in both these libraries and in
several others the whole known body of literature of the
subject.</p>

<p>In this investigation the writer came face to face with
utterly contradictory testimony from men who had known
Abraham Lincoln intimately.</p>

<p>Of him Mr. Herndon, for twenty years his law partner,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to Mr. Lincoln's religious views, he was, in short,
an infidel.... Mr. Lincoln told me a thousand times that
he did not believe the Bible was the revelation of God as the
Christian world contends."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 489.</p></blockquote>

<p>The direct antithesis of this statement is found in a narrative
of Hon. Newton Bateman, who knew Mr. Lincoln from
1842 until Mr. Lincoln's death, and whose office was in the
State House at Springfield next-door to that which, for a
period of eight months from the time of his nomination till
his departure for his inauguration, was occupied by Mr.
Lincoln. He affirmed (or at least was so quoted by Holland)
that Mr. Lincoln said to him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice and
slavery. I see the storm coming, and I know that His hand
is in it. If He has a place and work for me&mdash;and I think He
has&mdash;I believe I am ready. I am nothing, but truth is everything.
I know I am right because I know that liberty is right,
for Christ teaches it, and Christ is God."&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. G. Holland</span>:
<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 237.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Popular oratory has carried even farther these two extremes
of irreconcilable contradiction. On the one hand are
to be found scurrilous publications, shockingly offensive
against all good taste, declaring Lincoln to have been an
atheist, a mocker, a hypocrite, a man of unclean mind, and a
violator in his speech of all canons of decency. We will not
quote from any of these at present; but of the length to which
the other extreme can go, has gone, and continues to go, let
the following incident, gleaned from a recent English book,
serve as an illustration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the year 1861 the Southern States of America were
filled with slaves and slaveholders. It was proposed to make
Abraham Lincoln president. But he had resolved that if he
came to that position of power he would do all he could to
wipe away the awful scourge from the page of his nation's
history. A rebellion soon became imminent, and it was
expected that in his inaugural address much would be said
respecting it. The time came. The Senate House was packed
with people; before him was gathered the business skill and
the intellectual power of the States. With one son lying dead
in the White House, whom he loved with a fond father's
affection; another little boy on the borders of eternity; with
his nation's eternal disgrace or everlasting honor resting upon
his speech, he speaks distinctly, forcefully, and without fear.
Friend and foe marvel at his collected movements. They
know of the momentous issues which hang on his address.
They know the domestic trials that oppress his heart. But they
do not know that, before leaving home that morning, the
President had taken down the family Bible and conducted
their home worship as usual, and then had asked to be left
alone. The family withdrawing, they heard his tremulous
voice raised in pleadings with God, that He whose shoulder
sustains the government of worlds would guide him and
overrule his speech for His own glory. Here was the power
of this man's strength."&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. H. Morgan</span>: <i>Modern Knights-Errant</i>,
p. 104; quoted in Hastings' <i>Great Texts of the Bible</i>,
volume on "Isaiah," pp. 237-38.</p></blockquote>

<p>This incident is now an integral part of the best and most
recent homiletic work in the English language, and will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
used in thousands of sermons and addresses. It is a story
that carries its own refutation in almost every line. Mr.
Lincoln had no son either sick or dead and lying in the White
House or anywhere else at the time of his first inaugural, nor
had he as yet entered the White House; and the hours of that
day are fairly well accounted for; but this and similar incidents
illustrate the length to which the oratorical imagination
may carry a speaker either in the pulpit or on the platform,
and not only be preserved in books but pass the supposedly
critical eye of a careful compiler of material for sermons and
lectures.</p>

<p>If another book is justified, it should be one that does
more than compile that part of the evidence which appears to
support a particular theory. The compilation should be as
nearly complete as is humanely possible. But it must do more
than plunge the reader into this swamp of conflicting testimony.
It must somehow seek to evaluate the evidence and
present a reasonable conclusion.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the judgment of the present writer, religion
is more than opinion, and cannot be considered as a detachable
entity. Lincoln's religion was more than his belief, his conjecture,
his logical conclusion concerning particular doctrines.
It can only be properly appraised in connection with his life.
While, therefore, the writer does not now undertake a complete
biography of Lincoln, though cherishing some hope that
he may eventually write a book of that character, this present
work endeavors to study the religion of Lincoln not in detachment,
but as part and parcel of his life.</p>

<p>A word may be said concerning the author's point of view
and the experience which lies behind it. In his early manhood
he had an experience of several years which he considers of
value as affording a background for the interpretation of the
Lincoln material. For several years the author taught school
and afterward preached in the mountain region of Kentucky
and Tennessee amid social conditions essentially parallel to
those in which Mr. Lincoln was born and amid which he spent
his manhood up to the time of his going to Washington. The
same kind of preaching that Lincoln heard, not only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Kentucky but in the backwoods of Indiana and the pioneer
villages of central and southern Illinois, the present author
heard in his own young manhood as a teacher in district schools
far back beyond the sound of the locomotive's whistle or the
inroads of modern civilization. How that kind of preaching
affected the inquiring mind of the young Lincoln, the author
is sure he knows better than most of Lincoln's biographers
have known. The fierce theological controversies that waged
between the old-time Baptists and the itinerant Methodists, together
with the emphatic dogmatism of the Southern type of
Presbyterianism as it was held and preached in the Kentucky
mountains forty years ago and in southern Illinois and Indiana
eighty years ago are part of the vivid memory of the present
writer. A young man who refused to accept this kind of
teaching might be charged with being an infidel, and might
easily suppose himself to be one; but whether that would be a
just or fair classification depends upon conditions which some
of the controversialists appear not to have known or to
have been capable of appreciating through lack of experience
of their own.</p>

<p>This book attempts, therefore, to be a digest of all the
available evidence concerning the religious faith of Abraham
Lincoln. It undertakes also to weigh that evidence and to
pass judgment, the author's own judgment, concerning it.
If the reader's judgment agrees with the author's, the author
will be glad; but if not at least the facts are here set forth
in their full essential content.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2></div>

<p class="c">WHY THE BIOGRAPHIES DIFFER</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> many biographies of Abraham Lincoln differ widely in
their estimate of his religious opinions and life, partly because
the biographers approach the subject from widely differing
angles, and some of them are seeking in advance the
establishment of particular conclusions. But apart from that
personal bias, from which no author can claim to be wholly
free, the biographical study of Abraham Lincoln was itself
an evolution whose main outlines and processes it will be
profitable briefly to consider.</p>

<p>The first printed biographies of Mr. Lincoln appeared in
1860. They were the familiar campaign biography, such as
is issued for every candidate for the Presidency. The first
man who approached Mr. Lincoln with a proposal to write
his Life was J. L. Scripps of the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>. Mr.
Lincoln deprecated the idea of writing any biography.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why, Scripps, [said he] it is a great piece of folly to
attempt to make anything out of me or my early life. It
can all be condensed into a single sentence, and that sentence
you will find in Grey's 'Elegy':</p>

<p class="c">
'<i>The short and simple annals of the poor.</i>'
</p>

<p>That's my life, and that's all you or anyone else can make
out of it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Herndon</span>, I, 2.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln felt the meagerness of his biographical material,
but the biographers succeeded in making books about him,
Scripps wrote his booklet, and it appeared in thirty-two
closely printed double-column pages, and sold at twenty-five
cents. It is now excessively rare. Lincoln read the proof
and approved it. The "Wigwam" Life of Lincoln appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
simultaneously with the Scripps booklet, and it is not quite
certain which of the two emerged first from the press. It
contained 117 pages, of which the last seven were devoted to
Hannibal Hamlin, Republican candidate for Vice-President.
This also had a wide sale, and is now very rare. That Lincoln
did not read the proofs of this book is evidenced by the
name "Abram" instead of "Abraham" on its title page and
throughout the book. It relates that "when he was six years
old, his father died, leaving a widow and several children,
poor and almost friendless"; and in other respects shows that
Lincoln did not furnish the data of it, and also indicates how
meager was the biographical material at hand outside the
little sketch which Lincoln prepared for Scripps.</p>

<p>Another pamphlet, containing 216 pages, was "The Authentic
Edition" by J. H. Barrett, and still another, the
"Authorized" edition by D. W. Bartlett, which extended to
354 pages and was bound in cloth. Perhaps the best of these
campaign biographies of 1860 was that written by William
Dean Howells, then a young man and unknown to fame. Apparently
Lincoln furnished to each of these writers&mdash;except
the Wigwam edition&mdash;essentially the same material which
he had given to Scripps, or else they borrowed from Scripps,
with permission, and to this extent they were "authorized"
or "authentic." But there is no indication that Lincoln read
any of them except that of Scripps. Even this must have surprised
him when he beheld how his little sketch could be
spread out over as many as thirty-two pages.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1864 brought out a new crop of campaign
biographies, and these used essentially the same material
up to 1860, and found their new matter in the history of the
Civil War up to the date of their publication.</p>

<p>This campaign material still stood in type or stereotyped
pages when Lincoln was killed, and was hastily used again.
The author, who owns all the books cited above, has also
others which came from the press in May or June of 1865,
whose main part was taken over bodily from the campaign
biographies of 1864 and speaks of Lincoln as still living, while
the back part is made up of material concerning the assassi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>nation,
the funeral, and the trial of the conspirators. These
called themselves "Complete" biographies, but they were
merely revamped campaign booklets of 1864 with appended
matter and virtually no revision.</p>

<p>These works represent the first stage of the attempt to
make books out of the life of Abraham Lincoln. The outline
of the life itself is meager in all of them, and they are well
padded with campaign speeches; and the last of them, with
full and interesting details of the funeral services of Lincoln,
the death of Booth, and other matter lifted from the newspapers
of the period.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>The second epoch began with the publication of the Life
of Abraham Lincoln by John G. Holland in 1865. It was
by all odds the best of the books that undertook within a few
years after his death to tell the story of the life of Lincoln,
with some estimate of his place in history. It is also the book
which began the controversy concerning Lincoln's religion.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>The third period was introduced by the biography of
Abraham Lincoln by Ward Hill Lamon, which was issued in
1872. It was based upon manuscripts that had been collected
by William H. Herndon, who was supposed to have had a
considerable share in the work of its preparation. Herndon
emphatically denied writing any part of it, and said in a letter
to Mr. Horace White that it was written for Lamon by
Chauncey F. Black, son of J. S. Black, a member of Buchanan's
cabinet and a political enemy of Lincoln (Newton:
<i>Lincoln and Herndon</i>, p. 307). This valuable but unwisely
written book, containing many things offensive to good taste,
occasioned much controversy for its stark realism and what
seemed to many of Lincoln's friends misrepresentations.
Some of the intimate friends of Lincoln are alleged to have
bought a considerable part of the edition and destroyed the
books, but copies are in the principal libraries and in the best
private collections.</p>

<p>Unterrified by the reception which had been accorded
Lamon's work, William H. Herndon, for twenty years Lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>coln's
law partner, assisted by Jesse W. Weik, published in
1889 a Life of Lincoln, in three volumes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The storm of denunciation
that beat upon Herndon's head was fierce and long.
The greater part of the edition disappeared. Libraries that
contain it keep it under lock and key, and the prices bid for it
at occasional book auctions contrast strikingly with those for
which it went begging immediately after it was issued. Four
years later, assisted by Mr. Horace White, Mr. Herndon reissued
the book in two volumes, with those passages elided
which had given greatest offense.</p>

<p>These two biographies mark the rise and high-water mark
of the demand for "the real Lincoln"; and nobody can deny
that they were quite sufficiently realistic.</p>

<p>The next stage in the Lincoln biography was the ten-volume
Life of Lincoln by his former secretaries, John G.
Nicolay and John Hay. It was issued in 1890, and called itself
"a history." It is a history rather than a biography; the
biographical material in it was condensed into a single volume
by Mr. Nicolay in 1904. This work is monumental, and may
be said to attempt the giving of materials for the complete
Lincoln rather than to be in itself an effort within the proper
limits of biography.</p>

<p>The two-volume biography by John T. Morse, Jr., issued
in 1893, was the first constructive piece of work in this field
after the Nicolay and Hay material had become available;
and it remains in some respects the best short Life of Abraham
Lincoln; though the author's New England viewpoint militates
against his correct appraisal of many features of the life
of Lincoln.</p>

<p>The next period may be said to be the period of the
magazine Lincoln, and to be represented at its best by the
work of Ida M. Tarbell, which first appeared in <i>McClure's
Magazine</i>, beginning in 1895, and was subsequently issued in
book form in several editions beginning in 1900. This was
a pictorial biography, with much new illustrative and documentary
material, and is of permanent value.</p>

<p>Since 1900 the biographies that have been issued have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
largely been devoted to specialized studies, as of Lincoln as
a lawyer, Lincoln as a political leader, Lincoln as a statesman;
and there have been innumerable books and articles made up
of reminiscences of the men who knew Lincoln more or less
intimately.</p>

<p>None of the biographies before Holland attempted anything
that could be called a critical analysis of Lincoln's character.
There is virtually nothing in the earliest Lives of Lincoln
concerning his religion or any other important aspect
of his private and personal life. In the nature of the case
those books were superficial.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some of the more important biographies of
more recent years have made no attempt at systematic character
study. While there is something about Lincoln's religion
in almost every one of them, that topic has been quite
incidental and subordinate to the main purpose of most of
the larger books. The authors have been content to take
for the most part the ready-formed judgment of those whose
views most nearly accorded with their own.</p>

<p>The field of inquiry concerning Lincoln's religion is both
more narrow and broader than it would at first appear. Many
even of the more important biographical works about Lincoln
yield nothing of any real value, so far as this topic is concerned.
On the other hand, the subject has been exploited
in magazine articles, newspaper contributions, lectures and addresses
almost innumerable and by no mean consistent.</p>

<p>The task, then, is more and other than that of making a
scrapbook of what different authorities have said about
Abraham Lincoln's religion. A vast amount has been said by
people who had no personal knowledge of the subject they
were discussing and no adequate power of historical analysis.
The volume of really first-hand evidence is not so vast as at
first it appears; and while it cannot all be reconciled nor its
direct contradictions eliminated, it is not hopelessly beyond
the limits of constructive probability. It is possible to determine
some facts about the religion of Abraham Lincoln
with reasonable certainty and to interpret others in the light
of their probable bearing upon the subject as a whole.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE ENVIRONMENT OF LINCOLN'S BOYHOOD</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have read Buckle's <i>History of Civilization</i> to little effect
if we have not learned that the development of an individual
or a nation is profoundly influenced by environment. The
biographers of Lincoln would appear to have kept this fact
carefully in mind, for they have been at great pains to give to
us detailed descriptions of the houses in which Lincoln lived
and the neighborhoods where from time to time he resided.
Although the camera and the descriptive power of the biographers
have done much for us, they leave something to be
desired in the way of sketching a background from which the
Abraham Lincoln of the successive periods emerged into conditions
of life and thought that were more or less religious.
For the purpose of this present study the life of Lincoln
divides itself into four parts.</p>

<p>The first is the period of his boyhood, from his birth in
Kentucky until his coming of age and the removal of his
family from Indiana into Illinois.</p>

<p>The second is the period of his early manhood, from the
time he left his father's home until he took up his residence
in Springfield.</p>

<p>The third is the period of his life in Springfield, from his
first arrival on April 15, 1837, until his final departure on
February 11, 1861, for his inauguration as President.</p>

<p>The fourth is the period covered by his presidency, from his
inauguration, March 4, 1861, until his death, April 15, 1865.</p>

<p>Before considering at length the testimony of the people
who knew him, except as that testimony relates to these particular
epochs, we will consider the life of Lincoln as it was related
to the conditions in which he lived in these successive periods.</p>

<p>The first period in the life of Abraham Lincoln includes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the twenty-one years from his birth to his majority, and is
divided into two parts,&mdash;the first seven and one-half years of
his life in the backwoods of Kentucky, and the following thirteen
years in the wilderness of southern Indiana.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of the United States,
was born near Hodgenville, Kentucky, on Sunday, February
12, 1809. He was the second child of Thomas and Nancy
Hanks Lincoln, who were married near Beechland, Washington
County, Kentucky, on June 12, 1806, when Thomas was
twenty-eight and Nancy twenty-three. Nine days before the
birth of Abraham Lincoln the territory of Illinois was organized
by Act of Congress; the boy and the future State were
twin-born. For four years the family lived on the Rock
Spring farm, three miles from Hodgenville, in Hardin, now
Larue County, Kentucky. When he was four years old his
parents moved to a better farm on Knob Creek. Here he
spent nearly four years more, and he and his sister, Sarah,
began going to school. His first teacher was Zachariah Riney;
his second, Caleb Hazel.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1816, Thomas Lincoln loaded his household
goods upon a small flatboat of his own construction and
floated down Knob Creek, Salt River, and the Ohio, and
landed on the northern bank of the Ohio River. He thence
returned and brought his family, who traveled on horseback.
The distance to where the goods had been left was only about
fifty miles in a straight line from the old home in Kentucky,
but was probably a hundred miles by the roads on which they
traveled. Thomas doubtless rode one horse with a child behind
him, and Nancy rode the other, also carrying a child behind
her saddle.</p>

<p>When the family arrived at the point where the goods had
been left, a wagon was hired, and Thomas Lincoln, with his
wife, his two children, and all his worldly possessions, moved
sixteen miles into the wilderness to a place which he had
already selected, and there made his home. That winter and
the greater part of the following year were spent in a "half-faced
camp" from which the family moved in the following
autumn to a log cabin, erected by Thomas Lincoln. For more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
than a year he was a squatter on this farm, but subsequently
entered it and secured title from the government. Here
Nancy Hanks Lincoln died, October 5, 1818, when Abraham
was less than ten years old. A year later Thomas Lincoln
returned to Kentucky and married Sally Bush Johnson, a
widow, with three children. She brought with her better furniture
than the cabin afforded, and also brought a higher type
of culture than Thomas Lincoln had known. She taught her
husband so that he was able with some difficulty to read the
Bible and to sign his own name. On this farm in the backwoods
in the Pigeon Creek settlement, with eight or ten
families as neighbors, and with the primitive village of
Gentryville a mile and a half distant, Abraham Lincoln grew
to manhood. Excepting for a brief experience as a ferryman
on the Ohio River and a trip to New Orleans which he made
upon a flatboat, his horizon was bounded by this environment
from the time he was eight until he was twenty-one.</p>

<p>The cabin in which the Lincoln family lived was a fairly
comfortable house. It was eighteen feet square and the logs
were hewn. It was high enough to admit a loft, where Abe
slept, ascending to it by wooden pins driven into the logs.
The furniture, excepting that brought by Sally Bush, was very
primitive and made by Thomas Lincoln. Three-legged stools
answered for chairs, and the bedsteads had only one leg each,
the walls supporting the other three corners.</p>

<p>Of the educational advantages, Mr. Lincoln wrote in 1860:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild
animals still in the woods. There I grew up. There were
some schools so-called, but no qualification was ever required
of a teacher beyond readin', writin', and cipherin' to the Rule
of Three. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened
to sojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as
a wizard. There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition
for education."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicolay</span>, p. 10.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here he attended school for three brief periods. The first
school was taught by Azel W. Dorsey, when Abraham was ten
years old; the next by Andrew Crawford, when he was four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>teen;
and the third by a teacher named Swaney, whose first
name Mr. Lincoln was unable to recall in later life. His
schooling was under five different teachers, two in Kentucky
and three in Indiana. It was scattered over nine years and
embraced altogether less than twelve months of aggregate
attendance.</p>

<p>In Kentucky it is probable that his only textbook was
Webster's Elementary Speller. It was popularly known as the
"Old Blueback."</p>

<p>Webster's Speller is a good speller and more. Each section
of words to be spelled is followed by short sentences containing
those words, and at the end of the book are three illustrated
lessons in Natural History&mdash;one on The Mastiff, another
on The Stag, and the third on The Squirrel. Besides these are
seven fables, each with its illustration and its moral lesson.
I used this book in teaching school in the backwoods of Kentucky,
and still have the teacher's copy which I thus employed.</p>

<p>The two Kentucky schools which Lincoln attended were
undoubtedly "blab" schools. The children were required to
study aloud. Their audible repetition of their lessons was the
teacher's only assurance that they were studying;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and even
while he was hearing a class recite he would spend a portion
of his time moving about the room with hickory switch in
hand, administering frequent rebuke to those pupils who did
not study loud enough to afford proof of their industry.</p>

<p>In Indiana, Lincoln came under the influence of men who
could cipher as far as the Rule of Three. He also learned to
use Lindley Murray's English Reader, which he always believed,
and with much reason, to be the most useful textbook
ever put into the hands of an American youth (Herndon, I,
37). He also studied Pike's Arithmetic. Grammar he did not
study in school, but later learned it under Mentor Graham in
Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these schools was only about a mile and a
half distant from his home; the last was four miles, and his
attendance was irregular.</p>

<p>In the second school, taught by Andrew Crawford, he
learned whatever he knew of the usages of polite society; for
Crawford gave his pupils a kind of drill in social usages
(Herndon, I, 37).</p>

<p>In Swaney's school he probably learned that the earth was
round. A classmate, Katy Roby, afterward Mrs. Allen
Gentry, between whom and Abraham a boy-and-girl attachment
appears to have existed, and who at the time was fifteen
and Abe seventeen, is authority for the statement that as they
were sitting together on the bank of the Ohio River near
Gentry's landing, wetting their bare feet in the flowing water
and watching the sun go down, he told her that it was the revolution
of the earth which made the moon and sun appear to
rise and set. He exhibited what to her appeared a profound
knowledge of astronomy (Herndon, I, 39; Lamon's <i>Life</i>,
p. 70).</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to assume that Abraham knew
very much more about astronomy than the little which he
told to Katy Roby; but it is worth while to note in passing
that when Abraham Lincoln learned that the earth was round,
he probably learned something which his father did not know
and which would have been admitted by no minister whom
Abraham had heard preach up to this time.</p>

<p>We are ready now to consider the character of the preaching
which Abraham Lincoln heard in his boyhood. Direct
testimony is fragmentary of necessity; but it is of such character
that we are able without difficulty to make a consistent
mental picture of the kind of religious service with which he
was familiar.</p>

<p>A recent author has said that Lincoln never lived in a community
having a church building until he went to the legislature
in Vandalia in 1834 (Johnson, <i>Lincoln the Christian</i>, p.
31). This is probably true if we insist upon its meaning a
house of worship owned exclusively by one denomination, but
the same author reminds us that there was a log meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>-house<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
within three miles of Lincoln's childhood home in
Kentucky (p. 22).</p>

<p>Dr. Peters says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The prayers that Parson Elkin said above the mound of
Nancy Hanks were the first public prayers to which Abraham
ever listened"&mdash;<i>Abraham Lincoln's Religion</i>, p. 24.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is absurdly incorrect. Abraham Lincoln almost certainly
heard public prayers at intervals, probably from the time
he was three months old.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was born in February, or his mother
probably would have taken him to church earlier; but by May
or June, when there was monthly preaching at the log meeting-house
three miles away, she mounted a horse and Thomas
Lincoln another, he with Sarah sitting before him at the
saddlebow and she with Abraham in her arms, and they rode
to meeting. If they had had but one horse instead of two
they would have gone just the same. She would have sat
behind Thomas with Abraham in her arms and Thomas would
have had Sarah on the horse before him. Thomas Lincoln was
too shiftless to have a horse-block, but Nancy could mount
her horse from any one of the numerous stumps in the vicinity
of the home. She and every other young mother in the
neighborhood knew how to ride and carry a baby, and having
once learned the art, the young mother was not permitted to
forget it for several years.</p>

<p>Arrived at the log meeting-house, they hitched their horses
to swinging limbs, where the animals could fight flies without
breaking the bridle-reins. Nancy went inside immediately and
took her seat on the left side of the room; Thomas remained
outside gossiping with his neighbors concerning "craps" and
politics, and maybe swapping a horse before the service had
gotten fairly under way. After a while he heard the preacher
in stentorian tones lining and singing the opening hymn, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
thin, high voices of the women joining him feebly at first but
growing a little more confident as the hymn proceeded. Then
Thomas and his neighbors straggled in and sat on the right
side of the house. The floor was puncheon and so were the
seats; they were rudely split slabs, roughly hewn, and the
second sitting from either end had an added element of discomfort
in the projection of the two legs that had been driven
in from the under side and were not sawed off flush with
the surface of the slab. There were no glass windows. On
either side of the house one section of a log may have been
sawed out about four feet from the floor; but most of the light
of the interior came in through the open door in mild weather,
or was afforded by the fireplace in cold weather.</p>

<p>On the rude pulpit lay the preacher's Bible and hymn book,
if he had a hymn book&mdash;no one else had one; and beside
these were a bucket of water and a gourd. There was no
time in the service when Thomas Lincoln did not feel free
to walk up to the pulpit and drink a gourd of water, and
the same was true of every other member of the congregation,
the preacher included. As for Nancy, she spread her riding-skirt
on the seat under her and when her baby grew hungry she
nursed him just as the other women nursed their babies.</p>

<p>To such congregations the author of this present book
preached hundreds of times in the woods of Kentucky; and
there is no essential feature of the church services which he
does not know.</p>

<p>In the autumn, just before fodder-pulling time, there was
an occasional camp-meeting or big revival, followed by a
baptizing, which brought multitudes of people from long distances.
They brought their provisions, or they stayed with
friends, one cabin proving elastic enough to accommodate two
or three households. Under these conditions the author of this
book has slept many nights in houses of one room, with as
many beds as the room could well contain, inhabited not only
by the family but by visitors of both sexes; and in all that
experience he is unable to recall any incident that was immodest.</p>

<p>When the converts of the camp-meeting or revival were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
baptized, they were led into the water with due solemnity;
but as each one came to the surface he or she was likely to
break forth into shouting, a proceeding which, as the author
can testify, was sometimes embarrassing, if not indeed
perilous,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to the officiating clergyman.</p>

<p>Herndon tells us of the fondness of the Hanks girls for
camp-meeting and describes one in which Nancy appears to
have participated a little time before her marriage (I, 14).
We have no reason to believe that that was her last camp-meeting.</p>

<p>Thomas Lincoln is alleged by Herndon to have been a Free-will
Baptist in Kentucky, a Presbyterian in the latter part of
his life in Indiana, and finally a Disciple (I, 11). He does
not state where he obtained his information, but it is almost
certain that he got it from Sally Bush Lincoln on the occasion
of his visit to her in 1865; as she is the accredited source of
most of the information of this character.</p>

<p>I am more than tempted to believe that either she or
Herndon was incorrect in speaking of Thomas Lincoln's
earliest affiliation as a Free-will Baptist. There were more
kinds of Baptists in heaven and on earth than were understood
in her philosophy; and I question whether the Free-will Baptists,
who originated in New England, had by this time penetrated
to so remote a section of Kentucky. What she probably
told Herndon was that he was not of the most reactionary
kind&mdash;the so-called "Hardshell" or anti-missionary Baptists.
Of them we shall have something to say later. The Scripps
biography, read and approved by Lincoln, said simply that his
parents were consistent members of the Baptist Church.
Nicolay and Hay do not record the membership of Thomas
Lincoln in the Presbyterian Church, and one is more than
tempted to question the accuracy of Herndon at this point.
Presbyterianism had at that date very little part in the shaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the life of the backwoods of Illinois and Indiana, as we
shall see when we come to the life of Lincoln in Illinois.
Nicolay and Hay tell us that "Thomas Lincoln joined the
Baptist church at Little Pigeon in 1823. His oldest child,
Sarah, followed his example three years later. They were
known as consistent and active members of that communion"
(Nicolay and Hay, I, 32-33). If Sarah joined the Baptist
church in 1826, and the family was remembered as active in
that church, the relation of Thomas Lincoln with the Presbyterians
in Indiana must have been brief, for he left that State
in 1830. We are assured that he observed religious customs
in his home and asked a blessing at the table; for one day,
when the meal consisted only of potatoes, Abraham said to
his father, that he regarded those as "mighty poor blessings"
(Herndon, I, 24). While Thomas Lincoln was not an energetic
man, there is no reason to doubt the consistency of his
religion, in which he was certainly aided by Sally Bush Lincoln.
That he died in the fellowship either of the Disciples or
of the New Lights is probably correct; but the Presbyterian
membership in Indiana, while not impossible, appears more
likely to have been a mistake in Herndon's interpretation of
Mrs. Lincoln's narrative.</p>

<p>Herndon's statement concerning Thomas Lincoln's religion
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In his religious belief he first affiliated with the Free-will
Baptists. After his removal to Indiana he changed his adherence
to the Presbyterians&mdash;or Predestinarians, as they were
then called&mdash;and later united with the Christian&mdash;vulgarly
called Campbellite&mdash;Church, in which latter faith he is supposed
to have died" (I, 11-12).</p></blockquote>

<p>I am satisfied that Herndon is mistaken in two if not in
all three of these assertions. I am confident that Predestinarian
was not a popular or commonly understood name for
Presbyterians, but it was a name for one type of Baptists.
Mrs. Lincoln probably told Herndon that her husband joined
in Indiana, not the hardshell, or most reactionary kind of
Baptists, but the Predestinarians. Knowing that predestina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>tion
was a doctrine of Presbyterianism, Mr. Herndon assumed
that that was what the name implied. It implied nothing of
the sort. Thomas Lincoln probably belonged to the old Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit
Predestinarian Baptists, not quite as hard
in their shell as the Hardshells, but very different from the
Free-will Baptists or the Presbyterians, the kind whose
preachers were accustomed to shout&mdash;"I'd rather have a hard
shell than no shell at all!"</p>

<p>Dennis Hanks<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> was far from being impeccable authority
on matters where his imagination permitted him to enlarge,
but he seldom forgot anything, and still less frequently made
it smaller than it really was. If Thomas Lincoln had ever
sustained any relation to the Presbyterian Church, he would
surely have told it, or some member of his family, jealous as
those members were for the reputation of "Grandfather Lincoln,"
would not have failed to report it. In his interview with
Mrs. Eleanor Atkinson, in which his family participated,
Dennis evinced a definite attempt to set forth Thomas Lincoln
in as favorable a light as possible, and there was a high and
deserved tribute to his "Aunt Sairy," Thomas Lincoln's second
wife.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Aunt Sairy sartainly did have faculty. I reckon we was
all purty ragged and dirty when she got there. The fust thing
she did was to tell me to tote one of Tom's carpenter benches
to a place outside the door, near the hoss trough. Then she
had me an' Abe an' John Johnson, her boy, fill the trough with
spring water. She put out a gourd full of soft soap, and
another one to dip water with, an' told us boys to wash up fur
dinner. You just naturally had to be somebody when Aunt
Sairy was around. She had Tom build her a loom, an' when
she heerd o' some lime burners bein' round Gentryville, Tom
had to mosey over an' git some lime an' whitewash the cabin.
An' he made her an ash hopper fur lye, an' a chicken-house
nothin' could git into. Then&mdash;te-he-he-he!&mdash;she set some kind
of a dead-fall trap fur him, an' got Tom to jine the Baptist
Church. Cracky, but Aunt Sally was some punkins!"&mdash;<i>American
Magazine</i>, February, 1908, p. 364.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>I am of opinion that what Mrs. Sarah Bush Lincoln told
Herndon was that her husband sometimes attended the Presbyterian
service, and that the church he joined was the Baptist,
but not the Hardshell Baptist. But evidence is wholly lacking
that he had any connection with the Presbyterian Church, or
with the Free-will Baptists, of which latter sect he probably
never heard.</p>

<p>The church at Farmington of which Thomas Lincoln became
a member is not now in existence. I have endeavored
through investigation in Farmington, and by correspondence
with Mr. Robert T. Lincoln, to ascertain its denomination.
It called itself "Christian," and Herndon did not doubt that
that name indicated that it was a church of the denomination
sometimes called "Campbellite." But that is not certain.
Other denominations claim that as their distinctive name, and
one of them was at that time active in that part of Illinois.
My inquiries have brought me no certain knowledge on this
point; but Mr. Jesse W. Weik is of opinion that the denomination
was that known as "New Light." It is possible that
Herndon was in error in every one of his three affirmations
concerning the religion of Thomas Lincoln, and that the President's
father was never a Free-will Baptist, never a Presbyterian,
and never a Disciple or Campbellite. I have endeavored
to learn whether his change from the Baptist to the
"Christian" church was a matter of conviction or convenience,
but on this I have found nothing except a statement from
the minister who buried him, in which it would appear that his
change of polity was a matter of conviction. This minister
spoke very highly of Thomas Lincoln, whom he had known
well in the latter years of his life.</p>

<p>There has been undue attempt to credit the pious boy
Abraham with the religious service conducted over the grave
of his mother by Rev. David Elkin<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> some months after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
demise. There is no good authority for this legend. Herndon
probably tells the truth about it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Within a few months, and before the close of the winter,
David Elkin, an itinerant preacher whom Mrs. Lincoln had
known in Kentucky, happened into the settlement, and in response
to the invitation from the family and friends, delivered
a funeral sermon over her grave. No one is able now to
remember the language of Parson Elkin's discourse, but it is
recalled that he commemorated the virtues and good phases
of character, and passed in silence the few shortcomings and
frailties of the poor woman sleeping under the winter's snow."<br />&mdash;<span class="smcap">Herndon</span>,
I, 28.</p></blockquote>

<p>This does not compel us to believe that there had been no
preacher in the Pigeon Creek settlement since the death of
Nancy Hanks.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was customary among these Kentucky-bred
people to hold the funeral service some weeks or months after
the burial. The author of this volume has attended many such
services.</p>

<p>The reasons require some explanation. The dead were
commonly buried on the day following death. There were, of
course, no facilities for embalming or preserving the corpse for
any great length of time. Preachers were nearly all farmers;
and the particular minister with whose church the family was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
affiliated might be living at a considerable distance and be at
that time at some distant place upon his wide circuit. No
minister expected to preach every Sunday in any one place.
A monthly appointment was the maximum attempted; and
the more remote settlements were not reached statedly by any
one preacher oftener than once in three months. There were
occasional services, however, by other ministers riding through
the country and preaching wherever they stayed overnight.
It was the author's custom when coming unexpectedly into a
valley to spread word up and down the creek that there would
be preaching that night in the schoolhouse or in the home
where he was entertained. The impromptu announcement
never failed to bring a congregation.</p>

<p>What took David Elkin into Indiana we do not know.
He may have been looking for a better farm than he had in
Kentucky, where he could dig out a living between his preaching
appointments. He may have been burdened for the souls
of certain families formerly under his care and now gone out
like the Lincolns into a howling wilderness. The late summer
and early autumn between the end of corn-plowing and the
beginning of fodder-pulling afforded such a minister opportunity
to throw his saddlebags over his horse and start on a
longer circuit than usual; and the winter gave him still another
opportunity for long absence. He took no money and he collected
none, or next to none, but he had free welcome everywhere
with pork and corn pone for supper and fried chicken
for breakfast. Many a time the author of this volume has
ridden up to a house just before suppertime, has partaken with
the family of its customary cornbread and bacon or ham, and
after preaching and a good night's rest has been wakened in
the morning before the rising of the sun by a muffled squawk
and flutter as one or more chickens were pulled down out of
the trees. After this fashion did the people of the backwoods
welcome the messengers of the Lord.</p>

<p>Not necessarily on his next appearance in a settlement is
the preacher requested to conduct the funeral service of persons
deceased since his last visit. The matter is arranged with more
of deliberation. A date is set some time ahead and word is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sent to distant friends.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> After a time of general sickness such
as had visited Pigeon Creek in the epidemic of the "milk
sick," Parson Elkin may have had several funerals to preach
in the same cemetery or at the schoolhouse nearest at hand. I
have known a half-dozen funerals to be included in one sermon
with full biographical particulars of each decedent and detailed
descriptions of all the deathbed scenes, together with rapturous
forecasts of the future bliss of the good people who
were dead and abundant warnings of the flaming hell that
awaited their impenitent neighbors. Even those people who
had not been noted for their piety during life were almost
invariably slipped into heaven through a deathbed repentance
or by grace of the uncovenanted mercies of God. It is the
business of all preachers to be very stern with the living and
very charitable toward the dead.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>I must add a further word about the custom of deferred
funerals. Although the burial was conducted without religious
service, it was not permitted to be celebrated in neglect. The
news that a man was dying would bring the sympathetic neighbors
from miles around, and horses would be tied up the creek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and down while people waited in friendly sorrow and conversed
in hushed voices in the presence of the solemn dignity
of death. That night a group of neighbors would "sit up"
with the dead, and keep the family awake with frequent and
lugubrious song.</p>

<p>Next day the grave must be dug; and that required a considerable
part of the male population of the settlement. If
only two or three men came in the morning they would sit
and wait for others and go home for the dinner and come back.
It thus has happened more than once in my experience that
we have brought the body to the burial and have had to wait
an hour or more in sun or wind for the finishing of the
digging of the grave.</p>

<p>I remember well an instance in which death occurred in
the family of one of the county officials. His wife died suddenly,
and under sad conditions. I mounted my horse and
rode four or five miles to his home. I hitched my horse to
the low-swinging limb of a beech tree and threaded my way
among other horses into the yard, which was filled with men,
and up to the porch, which was crowded with women. Passing
inside, I spoke my word of sympathy to the grief-stricken
husband and his children. Then I passed out into the yard
and moved from group to group among the men. Presently
a neighbor of the sorrowing husband approached me and asked
me to step aside with him for private converse. This was
strictly in accordance with the custom of the country, and I
walked with him behind the corn-crib. He said to me: "Mr.
McCune"&mdash;naming the bereaved husband&mdash;"wants to know
whether you have come here as a preacher or as a neighbor?"
I answered, "Tell him that I have come as a neighbor."
With this word he returned to the house. Up on the hillside
I could see the leisurely movements of the grave-diggers.
From the shed behind the house came the rhythmic tap of
the hammer driving in the tacks that fastened the white glazed
muslin lining of the home-made coffin. We had some little
time still to wait before either the grave or the coffin would be
finished. Presently the neighbor returned to where I waited
behind the corn-crib and brought with him Mr. McCune. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
latter shook my hand warmly and said, in substance: "I
appreciate your coming and the respect which you thus show
for me and for my dead wife. I was glad to see you come
when you entered the house, but was a little embarrassed because
I knew it to be your custom to preach the funeral sermon
at the time of the burial. I have no objection to that custom;
and while we are Baptists [he pronounced it Babtist, and so
I have no doubt did Thomas Lincoln], there is no man whom
I would rather have preach my wife's sermon than you. We
shall undoubtedly have a Baptist preacher when the time for
the funeral comes, but I hope you also will be present and
participate in the service. But it is not our custom to hold
the service at the time of the burial, and we have distant
friends who should be notified. Moreover, there is another
consideration. I have been twice married, and I never yet
have got round to it to have my first wife's funeral preached.
It seems to me that it would be a discourtesy to my first wife's
memory to have my second wife's sermon preached before the
first. What I now plan to do is to have the two funerals at
once, and I hope you will be present and participate."</p>

<p>I need only add that before I departed from that region
he was comfortably married to his third wife, not having
gotten round to it to have the funeral sermon of either of his
first two wives. I am unable to say whether when he finally
got round to it there was any increase in the number. It never
was my fortune to conduct the joint funeral of two wives of
the same man at the same time; but I have more than once
been present where a second wife was prominent among the
mourners; and I sometimes believed her to be sincerely sorry
that the first wife was dead.</p>

<p>It is not easy for people who have not lived amid these
conditions and at the same time to have known other conditions
to estimate aright the religious life of a backwoods community.
Morse, whose biography of Lincoln is to be rated
high, is completely unable to view this situation from other
than his New England standpoint. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The family was imbued with a peculiar, intense, but
unenlightened form of Christianity, mingled with curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
superstition, prevalent in the backwoods, and begotten by the
influence of the vast wilderness upon illiterate men of a rude
native force. It interests scholars to trace the evolution of
religious faiths, but it might not be less suggestive to study
the retrogression of religion into superstition. Thomas Lincoln
was as restless in matters of creed as of residence, and
made various changes in both during his life. These were,
however, changes without improvement, and, so far as he was
concerned, his son Abraham might have grown up to be what
he himself was contented to remain" (I, 10).</p></blockquote>

<p>This criticism is partly just, but not wholly so. There
was superstition enough in the backwoods religion, and Abraham
Lincoln never wholly divested himself of it; but it
was not all superstition. There was a very real religion on
Pigeon Creek.</p>

<p>In like manner, also, it is difficult for Lincoln's biographers
to strike an even balance between adoring idealization
of log-cabin life and horrified exaggeration of its squalor.
Here again Morse is a classic example of the attempt to be so
honest about Lincoln's poverty as to miss some part of the
truth about it.</p>

<p>The Lincoln family was poor, even as poverty was estimated
in the backwoods. Lincoln himself was painfully impressed
with the memory of it, and Herndon and Lamon, who
understood it better than most of his biographers, felt both
for themselves and for Lincoln the pathos of his descent from
"the poor whites"; but there is no evidence that Lincoln
felt this seriously at the time. His melancholy came later,
and was not the direct heritage of his childhood poverty.
Life had its joys for families such as his. Poverty was
accepted as in some sort the common lot, and also as a
temporary condition out of which everybody expected sometime
to emerge. Meantime the boy Abraham Lincoln had not
only the joy of going to mill and to meeting, but also the
privilege of an occasional frolic. We know of one or two
boisterous weddings where he behaved himself none too well.
Besides these there were other unrecorded social events on
Pigeon Creek where the platter rolled merrily and he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
untangle his long legs from under the bench and move quickly
when his number was called or pay a forfeit and redeem it.
He played "Skip-to-My-Lou" and "Old Bald Eagle, Sail
Around," and "Thus the Farmer Sows His Seed," and he
moved around the room singing about the millwheel and had
to grab quickly when partners were changed or stand in the
middle and be ground between the millstones. As large a proportion
of people's known wants were satisfied on Pigeon
Creek as on some fashionable boulevards. We need not seek
to hide his poverty nor idealize it unduly; neither is it necessary
to waste overmuch of pity upon people who did not find
their own condition pitiable.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>What kind of man had been produced in this environment
and as the result of the conditions of his heredity and of his
inherent qualities? What do we know about the Abraham
Lincoln who in 1830 took simultaneous leave of Indiana and
his boyhood, and entered at once upon his manhood and the
new State, that, twin-born with him, was waiting his arrival?</p>

<p>He was a tall, awkward, uncouth backwoodsman, strong
of muscle, temperate and morally clean. He had physical
strength and was not a bully; was fond of a fight but fought
fairly and as a rule on the side of weakness and of right.
He was free from bad habits of all kinds, was generous, sympathetic,
and kind of heart. He was as yet uninfluenced by
any women except his own dead mother and his stepmother.
He was socially shy, and had not profited greatly by the
meager lessons in social usage which had been taught in
Andrew Crawford's school. He was fond of cock-fighting
and of boisterous sports, and had a sufficient leadership to
proclaim himself "the big buck of the lick" and to have that
declaration pass unchallenged.</p>

<p>He could read, write, and cipher, and was eager for learning.
He was ambitious, but his ambitions had no known
focus. He was only moderately industrious, but could work
hard when he had to do so. He had some ambition to write
and to speak in public, but as yet he had little idea what he
was to write or speak about. He was a great, hulking back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>woodsman,
with vague and haunting aspirations after something
better and larger than he had known or seemed likely
to achieve.</p>

<p>What do we know about the spiritual development of the
young Boanerges who grew almost overnight in his eleventh
year into a six-footer and was so wearied by the effort that
he was slow of body and mind and was thought by some to be
lazy ever afterward?</p>

<p>We know the books he read&mdash;the Bible, <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,
<i>Æsop's Fables</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and Weems' <i>Life of Washington</i>.
It was a good collection, and he made the most of it.
Sarah Bush Lincoln noted that while he did not like to work
he liked to read, and she said, "I induced my husband to
permit Abe to study" (Herndon, I, 36).</p>

<p>John Hanks said of him, "He kept the Bible and <i>Æsop's
Fables</i> always within reach, and read them over and over
again."</p>

<p>Sarah Bush did not claim that he showed any marked
preference for the Bible. Lamon quotes her as saying, "He
seemed to have a preference for the other books" (<i>Life</i>, pp.
34, 486). But he certainly read the Bible with diligence, as
his whole literary style shows. Indeed, if we had only his
coarse "First Chronicles of Reuben," which we could heartily
wish he had never written, and whose publication in Herndon's
first edition was one of the chief reasons for an expurgated
edition,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we should know that even then Abe Lincoln, rough,
uncouth and vulgar as he was, was modeling his style upon
the Bible.</p>

<p>We are told that when he went to church he noted the
oddities of the preachers and afterward mimicked them
(Lamon: <i>Life</i>, pp. 55, 486). This might have been expected,
for two reasons. First, he had a love of fun and of
very boisterous fun at that; secondly, he had a fondness for
oratory, and this was the only kind of oratory he knew anything
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the Lincoln family appears
never at any time in its history to have been strongly under
the influence of Methodism.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This is not because they did not
know of it; no pioneer could hide so deep in the wilderness as
to be long hidden from the Methodist circuit riders. But the
prevailing and almost the sole type of religion in that part of
Indiana during Lincoln's boyhood was Baptist, and in spite
of all that Mrs. Lincoln believed about the freedom of it, it
was a very unprogressive type of preaching. The preachers
bellowed and spat and whined, and cultivated an artificial
"holy tone" and denounced the Methodists and blasphemed
the Presbyterians and painted a hell whose horror even in the
backwoods was an atrocity. Against it the boy Abe Lincoln
rebelled. Many another boy with an active mind has been
driven by the same type of preaching into infidelity.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson quotes as indicative of the religious mind of
the young Lincoln the four lines<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which in his fourteenth year
he wrote on the flyleaf of his schoolbook, and the two lines
which he wrote in the copybook of a schoolmate:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Commenting on these Dr. Johnson says: "These show two
things: First, that the youthful boy had faith in his mother's
God; and, second, that he believed his mother's teachings."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In like manner Dr. Johnson takes the four hymns which
Dennis Hanks remembered to have been sung by himself and
Abe and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A soul that can appreciate these hymns must recognize,
first, that without the shedding of blood there is no remission
of sin; second, that Jesus Christ died upon the Cross for the
salvation of the world; third, that life without the Saviour is
an empty bubble, and, fourth, that loyal devotion to the Christ
and his cause is man's highest calling, and the test of true
character."&mdash;<i>Lincoln the Christian</i>, pp. 28-29.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is very far-fetched. It shows only that Abe sang
such songs, good, bad, and indifferent, as were current in his
day, and without any very fine discrimination either in songs
sacred or secular. If one were to make a creed out of any of
his poetry in this period, it were better to find it in his jingle,
about the Kickapoo Indian, Johnny Kongapod.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He was
supposed to have composed an epitaph for himself that ran on
this wise:</p>

<p>It matters not for our purpose that these lines were not
strictly original with Johnny Kongapod. We meet them in
George Macdonald's story "David Elginbrod," and they have
been used doubtless in rural England for generations. But
they involve a certain rude and noble faith that the Judge of
all the earth will do right and that divine justice and human
justice have a common measure. Lincoln never forgot that,
and he learned it on Pigeon Creek.</p>

<p>Herndon is our authority, if we needed any, that the Baptist
preaching of Lincoln's boyhood made him a lifelong
fatalist.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He emerged into manhood with the conviction that
"whatever is to be will be," and Mrs. Lincoln declared that
this was his answer to threats concerning his assassination;
that it had been his lifelong creed and continued still to be the
ruling dogma of his life.</p>

<p>It would have gladdened the heart of Sarah Bush if her
stepson, whom she loved with a tenderness almost surpassing
that which she bestowed upon her own flesh and blood, had
manifested in his youth some signs of that irresistible grace
which was supposed to carry the assurance of conversion as
an act not of man but of the Holy Spirit. He did not manifest
that grace in the form in which she desired. She could
not consistently blame him very much, for, according to her
own creed and that of Thomas Lincoln, nothing that he could
have done of his own volition would have mattered very much.</p>

<p>Horace Bushnell's <i>Christian Nurture</i> had not yet been
written; and if it had there was not a preacher among the
Baptists in southern Indiana who would not have denounced
it as a creation of the devil. There were no Sunday schools
in those churches, and when they began to appear they were
vigorously opposed. There was no Christian nurture for the
boy Abe Lincoln save the sincere but lethargic religion of his
father and the motherly ministrations of his stepmother.</p>

<p>But "Abe was a good boy." With tears in her eyes Sarah
Bush could remember that he never gave her a cross word.
He was unregenerate, but not unlovable; and he had more
faith than perhaps he realized.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE ENVIRONMENTS OF LINCOLN'S YOUNG<br />
MANHOOD</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second period of Lincoln's religious life extends from his
removal into Illinois in March of 1830 until the establishment
of his residence in Springfield, April 15, 1837.</p>

<p>Thomas Lincoln was a thriftless farmer who blamed external
conditions for his misfortunes. Following a second
appearance of the "milk sick," which came to southern Indiana
in the winter of 1829, he and his family removed in March
of 1830 to Illinois. Abraham was twenty-one years of age.
He assisted his father to get established in the new home, to
which a wearying journey of fourteen days had brought the
household, and then set out in life for himself. For several
months he worked near home, but in the spring of 1831 he
made his second flatboat trip to New Orleans. The boat
stuck on a dam at Rutledge's mill at New Salem, and his
ingenuity in getting it over the dam won him local fame and
had something to do with his subsequent establishment of a
home there. The flatboat stuck on April 19, 1831. In June
he returned to New Salem and entered into business with
Denton Offutt in a small and non-remunerative general store.
While waiting for the opening of this store he became acquainted
with Mentor Graham, a school teacher of local
celebrity, whom Lincoln assisted as clerk of a local election,
and through him learned the contents of Kirkham's Grammar,
and also acquired the essential elements of surveying. New
Salem was a sporadic town which had no good reason to exist.
It was established in 1829 and lasted barely seven years. It
was located on the Sangamon River, some fifteen miles from
Springfield.</p>

<p>In February, 1832, this flatboat hand, then working as
clerk, began his canvass for the Legislature, his formal an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>nouncement
of candidacy appearing March 9. He was defeated,
but received an encouraging local vote. In 1832 he
had a brief experience as a soldier, serving in the Black Hawk
War, starting in pursuit of the Indians on April 27 and
returning in July. Excepting for his absences at the Black
Hawk War and in attendance upon the meetings of the Legislature
in Vandalia, he was in New Salem practically during
the whole of the history of that little town. He established
a partnership in the firm of Lincoln &amp; Berry, keepers of a
general store, a business for which he had no qualification,
and he accumulated debts, which he was unable to pay in full
until after his first term in Congress seventeen years later.
On May 7, 1833, he became postmaster of the microscopic
village of New Salem, and held that position until May 30,
1836, about which date the town disappeared. In August,
1834, he was elected to the Legislature, then sitting at Vandalia,
and had an important share in the removal of the state
capital from there to Springfield.</p>

<p>In New Salem occurred two of Lincoln's three recorded
love affairs.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In 1834 he fell in love with Ann Rutledge, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
whom he became engaged, and who died, August 25, 1835.
In the autumn of 1836 he made love to Miss Mary Owens,
who refused him. These two love affairs are related in detail
by Lamon and by Herndon; the second of them gave rise to
Lincoln's letter to Mrs. Browning, one of the least creditable
things that ever came from his pen (Herndon, I, 192).</p>

<p>Heart-broken over the death of Ann Rutledge and ashamed
of himself for his lack of gallantry in his love affair with Miss
Owens, he saw New Salem doomed in all its hopes of being
a city.</p>

<p>While sitting about the store waiting for business which did
not come, he read law after a desultory fashion, becoming
what he called not inappropriately "a mast-fed lawyer." For
the benefit of any reader to whom this term conveys no meaning,
it may be stated that "mast" consists of acorns, nuts,
and other edible commodities, which hogs running at large in
the wilderness are able to feed upon. Between a hog corn-fed
in a stye and a backwoods mast-fed razor-back, there is a
marked difference, and Lincoln's phrase was a very apt one.
In the autumn of 1836 he obtained a law license. On March,
1837, he was admitted to the bar. On April 15, 1837, he
moved to Springfield.</p>

<p>With his Springfield experience we shall deal later; that is
an epoch by itself. We now consider the conditions of life in
New Salem and their influence in shaking the religious character
of Abraham Lincoln. New Salem, while an insignificant
hamlet, was located on the Sangamon River and received its
share of the travel to and from Springfield. Its central institutions
were its tavern, where Lincoln boarded, and the store,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
where he read grammar and law, discussed politics, and occasionally
sold goods.</p>

<p>The influence of life in New Salem upon the mind of
Abraham Lincoln was very marked. We must not make the
mistake of considering it solely in the character of a poor little
frontier town destined to short life and in its day of no
consequence to the world. To Lincoln it was a city, and it had
its own ambitions to become a greater city. Although it had
scarcely twenty houses, not one of them costing much over a
hundred dollars, and not more than a hundred inhabitants, it
was to him no mean city. Here Lincoln developed rapidly.
He read, discussed, thought, wrote, and spoke on a wide
variety of subjects. His style was that of florid declamation,
a stump oratory with some affectation of erudition. He made
the most of his few books, and every one of them left its deep
impression upon him. He continued to read the Bible, and
grew somewhat familiar with Shakespeare, Burns, and even
Byron. While there was no church building in New Salem,
and church services were irregular, such services as were held
were generally in the tavern where he boarded, a tavern kept
at first by James Rutledge and afterward by Henry Onstott.
It is interesting to cull out of T. G. Onstott's reminiscences a
number that are based on his own recollections, supplemented
perhaps by traditions received from his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After James Rutledge moved out of the log tavern, my
father, Henry Onstott, moved in and occupied it from 1833
till 1835, and still had for a boarder Abraham Lincoln. It
was at this time that my early impressions of him were formed.
We did not know at that time that we were entertaining an
angel unawares. My first knowledge of him was as a great
marble player. He kept us small boys running in all directions
gathering up the marbles he would scatter. During this time
he followed surveying, having learned in six weeks from
books furnished him by John Calhoun, of Springfield. About
this time he commenced to read some law-books which he borrowed
of Bowling Green, who lived one-half mile north of
Salem. I think my father and Esquire Green did more than
any other two men in determining Lincoln's future destiny."&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><span class="smcap">T. G. Onstott</span>: <i>Lincoln and Salem&mdash;Pioneers of Menard and
Mason Counties</i>, p. 25.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Lincoln's habits he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lincoln never drank liquor of any kind and never chewed
or smoked. We never heard him swear, though Judge Weldon
said at the Salem Chautauqua that once in his life when he
was excited he said, 'By Jing!'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Onstott</span>: <i>Lincoln and
Salem</i>, p. 73.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Peter Cartwright, Onstott says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was a great man for camp-meetings and prayer meetings.
He was converted at a camp-meeting, and in his early
ministry lived in a tented grove from two to three months
in a year. He said: 'May the day be eternally distant when
camp-meetings, class meetings, prayer meetings, and love feasts
shall be laid aside in Methodist churches.'...</p>

<p>"There was sound preaching in those days. The preachers
preached hell and damnation more than they do now. They
could hold a sinner over the pit of fire and brimstone till
he could see himself hanging by a slender thread, and he would
surrender and accept the gospel that was offered to him."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Onstott</span>:
<i>Lincoln and Salem</i>, pp. 120, 127.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of one of these preachers, Abraham Bale, Onstott says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He had a habit when preaching of grasping his left ear
with his hand, then leaning over as far as he could and lowering
his voice. He would commence to straighten up and his
voice would rise to a high key. He would pound the Bible
with his fist and stamp the floor, and carry everything before
him. He created excitement in the first years of his ministry
in Salem. He was a Baptist, though not of the hardshell
persuasion."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Onstott</span>: <i>Lincoln and Salem</i>, p. 149.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the general and accepted habit of Baptist
preachers in that movement, and the author has heard scores
of sermons delivered in this fashion.</p>

<p>Of the religious life of early Illinois and of frontier communities
in general, Professor Pease says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Religion came to be the most universally persuasive
intellectual force of the frontier. As might be expected, on
the frontier the first tendency was toward a disregard of
religious observances. The emigrant from the older settled
regions left behind him the machinery and the establishment
of sectarian religion. Until that machinery could be set up
again on the frontier he lived without formal worship and
often for the time at least the sense of the need of it passed
out of his life. In cases where observance had been due to
social convention, there was no doubt a welcome feeling of
freedom and unrestraint.</p>

<p>"Normally the frontiersman was unreligious. Birkbeck
noted with relish the absence of ceremony at baptism or funeral
and the tolerance of all backwoods preachers alike, whether
they raved or reasoned. Sunday was a day for riot and disorder.
Other observers looked with horror on such a state of
things, did their best to set up at least stated regular worship,
and noted an improvement in morals as a result."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pease</span>:
<i>Centennial History of Illinois</i>, II, 23.</p></blockquote>

<p>There were, however, some compensations. Fordham
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is not the land of hypocrisy. It would not here
have its reward. Religion is not the road to wordly respectability,
nor a possession of it the cloak of immorality."&mdash;<i>Personal
Narrative</i>, p. 128.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the sporadic nature of much of the religious effort on
the frontier, Professor Buck says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In spite of the tremendous exertions of the pioneer
preachers, many of the remote settlements must have been
practically devoid of religious observances, and even in the
older settlements the influence of occasional visitations, however
inspiring they might be, was often lacking in permanence."&mdash;<i>Illinois
in 1818</i>, p. 179.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the lack of permanence there may be some room for a
difference of judgment; there certainly was lack of continuity.
As in Kentucky and southern Indiana, and for a time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
southern Illinois, there was no expectation of a regular weekly
religious service conducted by any one minister, but preachers
moved in extended circuits and no considerable settlement was
long without occasional religious service.</p>

<p>There was much godlessness in many of the early settlements.
John Messenger wrote in 1815: "The American inhabitants
in the villages appear to have very little reverence
for Christianity or serious things in any point of view."</p>

<p>While there was some attempt at Sabbath observance,
Reynolds says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In early times in many settlements of Illinois, Sunday
was observed by the Americans only as a day of rest from
work. They generally were employed in hunting, fishing, getting
up their stock, hunting bees, breaking young horses, shooting
at marks, horse and foot racing, and the like. When
the Americans were to make an important journey they generally
started on Sunday and never on Friday; they often
said; 'the better the day the better the deed,'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Reynolds</span>:
<i>My Own Times</i>, p. 80.</p></blockquote>

<p>One must not infer from the irregularity of religious
services that the people in these new regions were wholly without
religion. Professor Buck says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The spiritual welfare of the Illinois pioneers was not
neglected. The religious observances, with the exception of
those of the French Catholics, were of the familiar type. The
principal Protestant denominations at the close of the territorial
period were the Methodists and the Baptists, the latter
classified as 'regular,' or 'hardshell,' and separating. Presbyterianism
was just beginning to get a foothold. The ministers
were of two types&mdash;the circuit rider, who covered wide
stretches of country and devoted all his time to religious work,
and the occasional preacher who supplemented his meager income
from the church by farming or some other occupation."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Buck</span>:
<i>Illinois in 1818</i>, p. 173.</p></blockquote>

<p>Governor Ford has left an account of the unlearned but
zealous frontier preachers, of their sermons, and of the results
of their work, which cannot easily be improved upon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Preachers of the gospel frequently sprang up from the
body of the people at home, without previous training, except
in religious exercises and in the study of the Holy Scriptures.
In those primitive times it was not thought to be necessary
that a teacher of religion should be a scholar. It was thought
to be his business to preach from a knowledge of the Scriptures
alone, to make appeals warm from the heart, to paint
heaven and hell to the imagination of the sinner, to terrify
him with the one, and to promise the other as a reward for
a life of righteousness. However ignorant these first preachers
may have been, they could be at no loss to find congregations
still more ignorant, so that they were still capable of instructing
someone. Many of them added to their knowledge
of the Bible, a diligent perusal of Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>,
Watts' hymns, Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and Hervey's <i>Meditations</i>,
a knowledge of which gave more compass to their
thoughts, to be expressed in a profuse, flowery language, and
raised their feelings to the utmost height of poetical enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Sometimes their sermons turned upon matters of controversy;
unlearned arguments on the subject of free grace,
baptism, free-will, election, faith, good works, justification,
sanctification, and the final perseverance of the saints. But
that in which they excelled, was the earnestness of their words
and manner, leaving no doubt of the strongest conviction in
their own minds, and in the vividness of the pictures which
they drew of the ineffable blessedness of heaven, and the
awful torments of the wicked in the fire and brimstone appointed
for eternal punishment. These, with the love of God
to sinful man, the sufferings of the Saviour, the dangerous
apathy of sinners, and exhortations to repentance, furnished
themes for the most vehement and passionate declamations.
But above all, they continually inculcated the great principles
of justice and sound morality.</p>

<p>"As many of these preachers were nearly destitute of
learning and knowledge, they made up in loud hallooing and
violent action what they lacked in information. And it was
a matter of astonishment to what length they could spin out
a sermon embracing only a few ideas. The merit of a sermon
was measured somewhat by the length of it, by the flowery
language of the speaker, and by his vociferation and violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
gestures. Nevertheless, these first preachers were of incalculable
benefit to the country. They inculcated justice and
morality, and to the sanction of the highest human motives to
regard them, added those which arise from a belief of the
greatest conceivable amount of future rewards and punishments.
They were truly patriotic also; for at a time when
the country was so poor that no other kind of ministry could
have been maintained in it, they preached without charge to
the people, working week days to aid the scanty charities of
their flocks, in furnishing themselves with a scantier living.
They believed with a positive certainty that they saw the souls
of men rushing to perdition; and they stepped forward to warn
and to save, with all the enthusiasm and self-devotion of a
generous man who risks his own life to save his neighbor from
drowning. And to them are we indebted for the first Christian
character of the Protestant portion of this people."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas
Ford</span>: <i>History of Illinois</i>, pp. 38-40.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of the hostility of certain of the early Baptists to enlightenment,
there is abundant evidence in their own fierce
opposition to their ablest minister, John Mason Peck. He was
born in 1789 in the Congregational atmosphere of Connecticut,
but, becoming a Baptist by conviction, became a missionary to
the West in 1817. His foes were they of his own household.
They fiercely fought against Bible societies, Sunday schools,
and missionary societies. In 1828, when Peter Cartwright and
James Lemen endeavored to secure the passage of a bill for
the prevention of vice and immorality, there was an attempt to
amend it in the interests of certain of the Hardshell Baptists
by adding to the section against the disturbance of public
worship a clause to fine in any sum not less than five dollars
or more than fifteen any person who on Sunday would sell
any pamphlet or book or take up an offering 'for the support
of missionary societies, Bible societies, or Sunday school.'
There were not less than twelve members of the House of
Representatives who voted for this bill."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pease</span>: <i>Centennial
History of Illinois</i>, II, 28, 29.</p></blockquote>

<p>One evidence of the hostility of many of the early inhabitants
and especially of some who were active in politics toward
organized religion, as well as the tendency of ministers of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
period to participate in politics, is found in the fact that Illinois
narrowly escaped having in her Constitution a provision disqualifying
all ministers to hold office in the State. When the
Constitutional Convention assembled at Kaskaskia this question
was earnestly discussed, and the controversy was waged
also in the columns of the <i>Western Intelligencer</i>, which was
published in Kaskaskia from 1806 to 1814. A writer who
signed himself "A Foe to Religious Tyranny" roundly denounced
the political sermons of certain of the ministers, and
charged that they intended to disqualify any citizens for office
excepting "professors of religion."</p>

<p>When the first draft of the Constitution was submitted in
August, 1818, Article II, Section 26, read: "Whereas the
ministers of the gospel are by their profession dedicated to
God and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted from
the great duties of their function: Therefore, no minister of
the gospel or priest of any denomination whatever, shall be
eligible to a seat in either house of the Legislature."</p>

<p>This article was warmly commended by a writer in the
<i>Intelligencer</i> under date of August 12, 1818, who commended
the framers of the Constitution for their provision "to exempt
ministers of the gospel from the servile and arduous drudgery
of legislation, and of electioneering to procure themselves seats
in the Legislature," but urged the convention to extend the
provision so as to disqualify ministers from holding any office
whatever. A number of members of the Constitutional Convention
favored this drastic proscription. On the first reading
the proposed article was approved; but it was later reconsidered
and voted down.</p>

<p>Ministers thus were left on a plane with other citizens as
regarded the holding of public office; and their candidacy for
the Legislature especially was not infrequent; indeed, one of
the writers who engaged in this controversy considered the
appalling possibility that the Constitutional Convention might
have been composed entirely of ministers, and that some future
session of the Legislature might find them in complete control.
There never was any danger that ministers would make up a
controlling faction in the Illinois Legislature; but they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
not a negligible element in the early political life of the
State.</p>

<p>Lincoln soon came into the political atmosphere which was
thus affected by religious controversy, and it had an influence
upon him. His most formidable and persistent opponent, until
he met Douglas, was a Methodist preacher, the redoubtable
Peter Cartwright who defeated him in a contest for the Legislature
and whom he defeated in a race for Congress. Lincoln
was quite familiar with religion in its relation to politics in
early Illinois.</p>

<p>Of Lincoln's theological opinions, especially those which
he cherished while at New Salem, and which Herndon believed
he did not materially change, Herndon says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Inasmuch as he was often a candidate for public office
Mr. Lincoln said as little as possible about his religious opinions,
especially if he failed to coincide with the orthodox world.
In illustration of his religious code, I once heard him say that
it was like that of an old man named Glenn, in Indiana,
whom he heard speak at a religious meeting, and who said,
'When I do good, I feel good; when I do bad, I feel bad;
and that's my religion.' In 1834, while still living in New
Salem, and before he became a lawyer, he was surrounded
by a class of people exceedingly liberal in matters of religion.
Volney's <i>Ruins</i> and Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i> passed from hand
to hand, and furnished food for the evening's discussion in
the tavern and village store. Lincoln read both these books,
and assimilated them into his own being. He prepared an
extended essay&mdash;called by many, a book&mdash;in which he made
an argument against Christianity, striving to prove that the
Bible was not inspired, and therefore not God's revelation,
and that Jesus Christ was not the Son of God. The manuscript
containing these audacious and comprehensive propositions
he intended to have published or given a wide circulation
in some other way. He carried it to the store, where it was
read and freely discussed. His friend and employer, Samuel
Hill, was among the listeners, and seriously questioning the
propriety of a promising young man like Lincoln fathering
such unpopular notions, he snatched the manuscript from his
hands, and thrust it into the stove. The book went up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
flames, and Mr. Lincoln's political future was secure. But his
infidelity and his skeptical views were not diminished."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Herndon</span>,
III, 439-440.</p></blockquote>

<p>We shall have occasion in a subsequent chapter to recur
to this so-called book which Lincoln is alleged to have written
while in New Salem. It is sufficient at this time to remember,
and the fact must not be overlooked, that our knowledge of
this book depends solely upon the testimony of Herndon.
Herndon never saw the book, and so far as is known he
never talked with anyone who had seen it. He affirms that
Lincoln never denied having written a book on the subject
of religion, but he nowhere claims that Lincoln told him in
detail concerning its contents. Herndon's principal visit, and
perhaps the only one which he made to New Salem in quest of
literary material, was in October in 1866. He had attended the
Circuit Court of Menard County on Saturday, October 13, and
on Sunday morning at 11:20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, as he tells us with painstaking
and lawyer-like particularity, he visited the site of New
Salem. That afternoon and a part of the next morning, which
he says was misty, cloudy, foggy, and cold, he made inquiry
of the oldest inhabitant of that part of the country and wrote
out the substance of his lecture on Ann Rutledge. This was
a whole generation after Lincoln had removed from the now
depopulated New Salem, and there were very few people in
the neighborhood who remembered him through any personal
association. The town had completely disappeared, but Herndon
found the site of the houses that once had stood there,
and also found and identified the grave of Ann Rutledge. To
that visit we are indebted for a good deal of our knowledge
of the background of Lincoln's life during this formative
epoch. But we are not bound to accept all of Mr. Herndon's
inferences regarding it.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Herndon's lecture did not
pass unchallenged. So small was the audience when he delivered
it and so uniformally unfavorable were the press comments
that he never repeated this lecture, and some of its
statements are open to question. It is not in this lecture that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
we learn of the essay which Lincoln is alleged to have written
in criticism of the Bible, but that was the visit on which
Herndon appears to have gathered his information concerning
Lincoln's more intimate relations with New Salem.</p>

<p>There is no good reason to doubt that Lincoln during this
period read Volney and Paine, and that having read them
he rushed rather quickly to paper and set down his immature
thoughts in argumentative fashion. It would divert us from
our present purpose of portraying the environment if we were
to consider in detail at this point the story of Lincoln's burnt
book. The reader will do well to remember, however, that
Herndon, though truthful, was not infallible nor on this point
free from bias; that neither Herndon nor anyone else then
living was known to have seen, much less to have read, the
book alleged to have been burned thirty-two years before; and
that there was abundant opportunity not only for exaggeration
but even for a complete misunderstanding concerning the
actual content of this book.</p>

<p>Indeed, this incident has been allowed to pass with too
little criticism or challenge. Those who did not believe Lincoln
to have been a man of faith were glad to accept the story;
those who believed that he later was a man of faith were
not wholly unwilling to believe that he had once been an
infidel and later had undergone a marked change of opinion.
There seemed no good reason to dispute Herndon, and no one
else was supposed to know more about the subject than he.
But we shall discover that Herndon may not have learned the
whole truth. There is more than a possibility that the manuscript
that was burned was a document of quite another sort.</p>

<p>If Lincoln was regarded as an infidel, and if he ever was
tempted to think himself one, we should not be justified in
accepting that judgment as final until we knew and considered
what was required in that time and place to constitute a man
an infidel.</p>

<p>In the mind of most if not all of the Baptist preachers
whom Lincoln heard while he was at New Salem, a belief
that the earth was round was sufficient to brand a man as an
infidel. The Methodists, as a rule, would have admitted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the earth was round, but Peter Cartwright would probably
have considered a man an infidel who believed that the earth
was not created in seven literal days. At Vandalia, Lincoln
heard some ministers of wider vision, such as Edward Beecher
and Julian M. Sturtevant, who were occasionally there, and
John Mason Peck; but these experiences were rare. His association
with Methodists was largely in the political arena,
where he crossed swords three times with Peter Cartwright.
That doughty hero of the Cross was born in Virginia on
September 1, 1786, and exerted a mighty influence for good in
early Illinois. With a nominal salary of $80 a year, and an
actual salary of $30 or $40, he rode thousands of miles through
deep mud, baptized 8,000 children and 4,000 adults, conducted
camp-meetings and political campaigns, and sang and shouted
and in his own language whipped the devil round the stump
and hit him a crack at every jump until his death at Pleasant
Plains, Illinois, September 25, 1872. He defeated Lincoln
for the Legislature, and was defeated by him for Congress in
1846. So far as we know, Lincoln left no record of his
feeling toward Cartwright and the Methodists. He could not
have failed to respect such men, but it is not altogether certain
that he was tempted to love them.</p>

<p>By the time Lincoln was seventeen, and possibly earlier,
he believed the earth to be round. I shall not succeed in making
the reader understand the possible effect of this discovery
upon him and certain of his associates without relating an
experience of my own.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1881, being then a college student on
vacation, I taught school in the mountains of Kentucky far
beyond the end of the railroad. The school was a large and
prosperous one and brought many students from other districts
who paid a trifling tuition and were preparing to teach.
The curriculum included everything from the alphabet to a
simplified normal course. A majority of my pupils had but
one textbook, Webster's Blueback Speller. I endeavored to
make up for the lack of textbooks by lessons in the Natural
Sciences and in such other branches of study as seemed adapted
to the requirements of my pupils. After a few weeks one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
my pupils, son of a Baptist minister, was taken out of school.
His father being interviewed stated that he was sorry to have
the boy lose his education, but could not afford to permit him
to be converted to infidelity. What the boy had learned which
disturbed his father was that the earth was round.</p>

<p>The subject provoked widespread discussion, and finally
resulted in a joint debate between two school teachers and
two Baptist preachers on the question:</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the earth is flat and stationary, and that
the sun moves around it once in twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>At early candle-lighting on two successive Friday evenings
this question was debated. On each night the procedure was
the same. Each of the speakers spoke forty-five minutes, and
each of the leaders spent a half-hour in rebuttal, a total of four
hours each evening of solid oratory. I should like to relate,
but it would unduly extend this narrative, the learned arguments
of the two college students who stood for the rotundity
of the earth, and how those arguments were met. I well
remember the closing argument of my chief opponent, not
the local preacher but an abler man whom he brought in, the
cousin of a Confederate General of the same name (though
himself a stanch Union man) who stood beside and above
me with long descending gestures that threatened to crush
my skull as he shouted:</p>

<p>"He's a college student-ah! And he's come out here to
larn us and instruct us about the shape of the yarth-ah! And
he knows more'n Joshua-ah! And he'd take Joshua into this
here school and tell him he didn't know what he'd ort to pray
for-ah! He'd tell Joshua that he hadn't orter said, 'Sun, stand
thou still upon Gibeon-ah, and thou moon in the valley of
Ajalon-ah!' He'd tell Joshua that he'd ort to have prayed,
'Yarth, stand thou still upon thine axle-tree-ah!' But I
reckon God knowed what Joshua had ort to have prayed for,
for it is written in the Word of God that the sun stood
still-ah! I tell ye, brethering, hit's the doctrine of infidelity-ah!
And any man that teaches it ort to be drove out of the
country-ah!"</p>

<p>There is much more of the story, but this must suffice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to illustrate an important point. Until he went to live in
Springfield, Abraham Lincoln probably never had heard a
Baptist preacher, unless it was John Mason Peck on some
errand to Vandalia, who did not believe the earth flat, and
who would not have classified Abraham Lincoln as an infidel
for denying the declaration.</p>

<p>Now, I knew that I was not an infidel, even though I
parted company with my friends in the Baptist ministry in
my belief that the earth was round, and even though I had a
similar debate with a well-informed Methodist preacher on
the length of time that was required to make the earth. But
Abraham Lincoln did not know. Thomas Paine and the
preachers were agreed in their misinformation.</p>

<p>I count it a privilege to have lived with earnest and intelligent
people who believed the earth flat, and to whom that
belief was an important article of Christian faith. But I
saw intelligent young men who had come to another opinion
concerning some of these matters who accepted without protest
the names that overzealous mountain preachers applied to them,
and who, believing themselves to be infidels, in time became so.</p>

<p>Not many of Lincoln's biographers, if indeed any of them,
have shared these advantages which for several profitable
years I had in the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee;
and I am less ready than some of even the most orthodox of
them have been to accept the declaration that when Lincoln
left New Salem he was an infidel. Even if I knew that he
thought himself to be such, I should like before forming my
final conclusion to know just what he thought constituted an
infidel. I do not think that at this period of his history
Abraham Lincoln possessed an adequate knowledge of the
subject to have been altogether competent to classify himself.</p>

<p>A few things we know about him. He had established a
reputation for courage, for kindness, and for honesty.
"Honest Abe" was his sobriquet, and he deserved it. Whatever
his opinions, he held them honestly; and neither on earth
nor in heaven can any man be rightfully condemned for the
holding of an honest opinion.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion later to refer to Mentor Graham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and to quote him. He came into Lincoln's life at this time,
and taught him Kirkham's Grammar, and the study of surveying,
and assisted him with his literary composition. He
knew more of the mind of Abraham Lincoln during this period
than any other man, and we shall hear from him in due
time.</p>

<p>New Salem "winked out," as Lincoln was accustomed to
say. It disappeared from the map. The post-office was discontinued.
There was nothing to hold Lincoln there. But
the great city of Springfield, with its one thousand inhabitants
and its majestic pride in its new State Capitol, which Lincoln
had done much to remove thither from Vandalia, beckoned
to this ambitious young lawyer and politician, and on March
15, 1837, he borrowed a horse, rode to Springfield with all his
worldly goods in his saddlebags, and the saddlebags none too
full, and thereafter became a resident of the capital city of
Illinois, and a permanent factor in its legal and political life.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Lincoln arrived in New Salem on April 19, 1831, a tall,
lank flatboat hand, with his trousers rolled up "about five
feet," and he left it on a borrowed horse with all his belongings
in a pair of saddlebags, March 15, 1837. So far as
worldly wealth was concerned, he was richer when he arrived
at the age of twenty-two than when he left at the age of
twenty-eight, for he was heavily in debt. It had fared better
with him financially had he spent those six years in Illinois
College at Jacksonville. He might have entered Springfield
at the same time with a college diploma and a smaller debt.
A college education was not impossible for him, and he might
have had it had he cared for it as much as did the Green
brothers or the brother of Ann Rutledge, or, among his later
associates, Shelby M. Collum or Newton Bateman. It is a
fair question whether an education under such good and
great men as Julian M. Sturtevant and Edward Beecher would
have been more or less valuable than what he actually got;
in any event, it was not an impossibility if he had cared as
much for it as did some other boys as poor as he.</p>

<p>But New Salem was his <i>alma mater</i>, as Mrs. Atkinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
has aptly termed it, and there he got what had to stand as
the equivalent of his academic course.</p>

<p>To have seen him entering New Salem on a flatboat and
leaving it on a borrowed horse, one might easily have arrived
at very erroneous conclusions as to what the six years had
done for him. But the years were not lost.</p>

<p>He came to New Salem a strong pioneer, proud of his
great height, and he always remained almost childishly proud
of it, and ready to challenge any other tall man to back up to
him and discover which was the taller. He was capable of
hard work, and disinclined to perform it. Thomas Lincoln
had taught him to work, but not to love work; and his employers
declared that he loved labor far less than his meals
and pay. If he must work, he preferred almost any kind of
work rather than that of the farm, and he had welcomed the
brief experiences of the river and had serious thoughts of being
a blacksmith. He had prized his great strength less for the
labor he might perform than for the supremacy which it gave
him in physical contests; and it had made him the admired
leader of the local wrestlers and the idol of the Clary Grove
gang.</p>

<p>He had come to New Salem able to read, and to make
what he called "rabbit tracks" as clerk on election day,
assisting Mentor Graham, who rewarded him many fold in
what he later taught to the young giant. He left New Salem
a competent surveyor, a member of the bar, a representative
in the Legislature, and, he might have called himself Captain,
if he had chosen to do so, or even taken advantage of the
frontier's ready system of post-bellum promotions and acquired
higher rank as an officer who had seen actual military
service. He had the good sense not to do this, and about the
only commendable thing in his one important speech in Congress
in later years was his mirthful description of his own
military performance.</p>

<p>He had learned to think, to compose reasonably good
English, to stand on his feet and debate. He had learned to
measure his intellectual strength against that of other men,
and to come out ahead at least part of the time. He was pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>sessed
of almost inordinate ambition, and had no false notion
that in his case the office was to seek the man;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he was more
than ready for any office that would support him, enable him
to reduce his "national debt," and advance him toward something
higher. He was entering the profession of the law, but
law was to him as yet a means to an end, and that end was
office. Politics was the vocation and law the avocation in a
large percentage of the law offices in Illinois and other new
States; and Lincoln was a politician long before he was a
lawyer.</p>

<p>His residence in New Salem had tested his moral character
and confirmed his personal habits. He did not drink nor
swear nor use tobacco.</p>

<p>In a state of society such as then existed, there was almost
nothing which such a young man might not have aspired to,
and Lincoln had high self-esteem and large aspiration. From
this distance we see him leaving New Salem to "wink out"
while he rode his borrowed steed far beyond Springfield, to
tether him at last where Thomas Jefferson is alleged to have
hitched his horse, to the palings of the White House.</p>

<p>But it was no exultant mood which possessed the soul of
Lincoln as he turned his back upon his <i>alma mater</i> and went
forth to conquer the world. He was a briefless lawyer, and
bedless as well as briefless. He had met and mastered men,
but had become painfully aware of his own poverty, his lack
of education, his utter ignorance of the usages of even such
polite society as had been in New Salem, to say nothing of
that in Springfield.</p>

<p>He was unsettled in love and unsettled in religion, though
he had been on speaking terms with both. He had loved and
lost Ann Rutledge, and he did not love Mary Owens and
could not lose her. He was about to begin one of the loneliest
periods of his very lonely life. For a year only one woman
in Springfield spoke to him, and she would rather not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
done so. He did not go to church nor mingle in society, but
faced the hard and bitter problems that confronted him in
earning a living, making some small payments on his debt,
settling his relations with Mary Owens, and possibly giving
some thought to his soul. But this was not a time of one of
his spiritual high water-marks.</p>

<p>If we had seen Abraham Lincoln as he entered New Salem
and again six years later as he left it, we should have found
small reason to anticipate very much of what afterward
occurred. But looking back upon him in the light of what
occurred afterward, we discern the "promise and potency"
of the great man he afterward became in the sad young man
who already had become a leader of men, and had earned the
right to be called "Honest Abe."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE ENVIRONMENT OF LINCOLN'S LIFE IN<br />
SPRINGFIELD</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span> became a resident of Springfield on Wednesday,
March 15, 1837, and continued to live there until his
removal, Saturday, February 11, 1860, to assume his duties
as President of the United States. He was accepted as
partner by his friend and former commander, Major John T.
Stuart, and shared an office in which politics was the major
interest and law was incidentally practiced. His partnership
with Stuart continued for four years, from April 27, 1837,
until April 14, 1841. His next partnership was with Judge
Stephen T. Logan, and extended from April 14, 1841, to
September 20, 1843.</p>

<p>He then formed a partnership with William H. Herndon
which began on the day of the dissolution of the partnership
with Judge Logan and was never formally dissolved. Lincoln
had a working alliance with some lawyer in almost every
county seat which he habitually visited, whereby the local
lawyer secured the cases and worked them up, and Lincoln
took them in charge as senior counsel when they came to trial.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
These were not formal partnerships, though they were often
so spoken of. This method gave him a large practice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
brought him into contact and collision with the ablest lawyers
in central and southern Illinois.</p>

<p>In 1838 and again in 1840 he was re-elected to the Legislature,
and showed little of the ability which he later manifested,
but was a faithful member, and he flung himself with ardor
into the noisy campaign of 1840.</p>

<p>In 1842 he had his "duel" with James T. Shields, and
later had the good sense to be ashamed of it.</p>

<p>In 1846 he ran for Congress, and at this third attempt
was elected, taking his seat December 6, 1847, and continuing
for two years.</p>

<p>The slavery issue was becoming dominant. Lincoln was
not at the outset an abolitionist, and was unwilling to be
placed in a position where he would be compelled to imperil
his political chances by taking too definite a stand on this
divisive measure; but on March 3, 1837, he introduced into
the Legislature a vigorous protest against the aggressions of
the pro-slavery party, a protest which probably failed to affect
his political future because it contained only one signature
beside his own. Only a few months later occurred the
martyrdom of Owen Lovejoy at Alton, and the slavery issue
was no longer one to be kept in the background. It is good
to be able to remember that Lincoln's first protest against
it was recorded before it had become so burning an issue. He
himself dated his hostility to slavery to what he saw of a
slave market in New Orleans when he visited that city as a
boat hand. But he was unable to remember a time when he
had not believed that slavery was wrong.</p>

<p>On other moral questions he now began to speak. He
delivered an address on Temperance on Washington's Birthday
in 1842. His first notable oratorical flight outside the
spheres of politics and law was delivered before the Young
Men's Lyceum of Springfield on January 27, 1837, and was
on "The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions." It
took him longer to say it than it did at Gettysburg, and it
was not so well said, but the rather florid lecture was intended
to mean essentially the same thing which he later expressed
much more simply and effectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>His most important case that had a bearing on the slavery
issue was that of Bailey <i>vs.</i> Cromwell, when he was thirty-two
years of age. In preparing to argue before the Supreme
Court of Illinois in favor of the freedom of a slave girl,
he learned the legal aspects of the question which later he was
to decide on its military and ethical character.</p>

<p>In 1858 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the United
States Senate against Stephen A. Douglas, and conducted that
series of debates which made him known throughout the
nation as the champion of freedom in the territories, and of
the faith that the nation could not forever endure half slave
and half free. In the autumn of 1859 he visited Kansas, and
was hailed as the friend of freedom.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, February 27, 1860, he delivered an
address in Cooper Union in New York City, an address
which greatly extended his fame. On the preceding Sunday
he attended Plymouth Church and heard and met Henry
Ward Beecher.</p>

<p>On May 16, 1860, he was nominated for the Presidency
of the United States by a great convention meeting in a
temporary structure known as "the Wigwam" standing
on Lake and Market Streets near the junction of the two
branches of Chicago River. On November 7, 1860, he was
elected President.</p>

<p>On Friday, November 4, 1842, he was married to Miss
Mary Todd. She was born in Lexington, Kentucky, December
13, 1818, and had come to Springfield to be with her
sister, Mrs. Ninian W. Edwards, in whose home the marriage
occurred. Concerning this marriage and the events which
went before and after, much has been written and nothing
need here be repeated.</p>

<p>When Lincoln arrived in Springfield, he found himself
for the first time in his life living in a town with churches
that held service every Sunday, and each church under the
care of its own minister. Springfield had several churches,
and he did not at first attend any of them. This does not
seem to have been on account of any hostility which he entertained
toward them, but his first months in Springfield were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
months of great loneliness and depression. He was keenly
conscious of his poverty and of his social disqualifications.
He was still tortured by his unhappy love affair with Mary
Owens. More than a year after his arrival in Springfield
he wrote to her that he had not yet attended church and
giving as the reason that he would not know how to behave
himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business,
after all; at least, it is so to me. I am quite as lonesome
here as I ever was anywhere in my life. I have been spoken
to by but one woman since I have been here, and should not
have been by her if she could have avoided it. I have never
been to church yet, nor probably shall not be soon. I stay
away because I am conscious I should not know how to behave
myself. I am often thinking about what we said of your
coming to live at Springfield. I am afraid you would not be
satisfied. There is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages
here, which it would be your doom to see without sharing
it. You would have to be poor, without the means of
hiding your poverty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln's habit with respect to churchgoing underwent
no very marked improvement after his marriage until the year
1850. He came, however, to know a number of ministers<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and to sustain somewhat pleasant relations with some of
them.</p>

<p>Mary Todd had been reared a Presbyterian. For a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
after her marriage she attended and was a member of the
Episcopal Church. On February 1, 1850,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> their second son,
Edward Baker Lincoln, died. The little boy was between
three and four years old. The rector of the Episcopal Church
was absent from the city and the funeral service was conducted
by Rev. James Smith, D.D., of the First Presbyterian
Church. A friendship was established between them, and Mr.
Lincoln took a pew in Dr. Smith's church and he and Mrs.
Lincoln attended there regularly.</p>

<p>In a later chapter we shall have occasion to consider more
directly and at length the influence of Dr. Smith upon Mr.
Lincoln. We now confine ourselves to the fact that Lincoln
now became a church attendant under the ministry of a
preacher quite different from any he had previously known.</p>

<p>James Smith was a large and stalwart Scotchman. He is
described as Websterian in appearance and in the strength
of logical argument. Lamon speaks of him in contemptuous
phrase which reflects little credit upon Lamon, describing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
as a man of slender ability. Whatever Dr. Smith was, he
was not a man of meager intellectual power. He had a
massive mind and one well trained. He had a voice of great
carrying power and was accustomed to speaking to large
congregations both indoors and out. He was a wide reader
and a skilled controversialist. In his own young manhood
he had been a deist, and when he was converted he entered
with great ardor into various discussions with men who
opposed the Christian faith. One such discussion he had
engaged in with a widely known infidel author. The debate
had continued evening after evening in a Southern city for
nearly three weeks and Dr. Smith had emerged from it triumphant.</p>

<p>Dr. Smith was just the kind of man to win the admiration
of Lincoln at that time. There is some reason to believe that
Dr. Smith's three weeks' debate with C. G. Olmsted at
Columbus, Mississippi, suggested to Lincoln the idea of his
debate with Stephen A. Douglas.</p>

<p>That Lincoln's views underwent some change at this time
there is the best reason to believe. Lincoln himself declared
to his brother-in-law, Ninian W. Edwards, that his views had
been modified.</p>

<p>Lamon and Herndon both seek to represent Dr. Smith
as an officious, self-advertising meddler, who sought to win
renown for himself by proclaiming Mr. Lincoln's conversion
through his personal influence. The claims and conduct of
Dr. Smith do not seem to merit any such rebuke. Whatever
Dr. Smith claimed, Mr. Lincoln knew about it and was not
offended by it. Subsequently he appointed Dr. Smith's son
United States Consul to Dundee, Scotland, and on the son's
return to the United States Mr. Lincoln appointed his father,
who by that time had retired from the ministry, to succeed
him in that position. Even Lamon is compelled to admit
that Dr. Smith's claims were made with Mr. Lincoln's knowledge,
and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln permitted himself to be misunderstood and
misrepresented by some enthusiastic ministers and exhorters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
with whom he came in contact. Among these was the Rev.
Mr. Smith, then pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of
Springfield, and afterward consul at Dundee, in Scotland,
under Mr. Lincoln's appointment."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
p. 498.</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement is thoroughly discreditable, and that which
follows in Lamon's account of Mr. Lincoln's relations with
Dr. Smith is a thorough misrepresentation, as we shall later
discover. Lamon was not a deliberate liar; neither was he
in this matter free from prejudice; and he wrote with reckless
disregard of some facts which he did not know but ought
to have known, and which the reader of this book shall know.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Lincoln received word that his own
father was dying, and was prevented from making him a personal
visit, which, apparently, he was not wholly sorry for.
On January 12, 1851, he wrote to his stepbrother, John D.
Johnson:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I sincerely hope father may recover his health, but, tell
him to remember to call upon and confide in our great and
good and merciful Maker, who will not turn away from him
in any extremity. He notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers
the hairs of our head, and He will not forget the dying
man who puts his trust in Him. Say to him that if we could
meet now it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful
than pleasant, but that if it be his lot to go now, he will soon
have a joyous meeting with many loved ones gone before, and
where the rest of us, through the help of God, hope ere long
to join them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even Herndon grew indignant when anyone attempted
to explain away that letter, or to make it seem anything less
than it purported to be. He said in his letter to Mr. Abbott,
under date of February 18, 1870:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has been said to me that Mr. Lincoln wrote the above
letter to an old man simply to cheer him up in his last moments,
and that the writer did not believe what he said. The question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
is, Was Mr. Lincoln an honest and truthful man? If he was,
he wrote that letter honestly, believing it. It has to me the
sound, the ring, of an honest utterance. I admit that Mr.
Lincoln, in his moments of melancholy and terrible gloom,
was living on the border land between theism and atheism,
sometimes quite wholly dwelling in atheism. In his happier
moments he would swing back to theism, and dwell lovingly
there.... So it seems to me that Mr. Lincoln believed
in God and immortality as well as heaven&mdash;a place."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>,
p. 495.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another incident comes to us from this period and is
related by Captain Gilbert J. Greene. He was a young printer
living in Springfield, and at the time of this incident was
eighteen years of age. Whether the story was in any way
exaggerated we may not certainly know, but it is here given
as he himself furnished it for publication and is now printed
with one or two other Lincoln stories in a small volume in
limited edition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Greene,' said Lincoln to him one day on the streets
of Springfield, 'I've got to ride out into the country tomorrow
to draw a will for a woman who is believed to be on her
deathbed. I may want you for a witness. If you haven't
anything else to do I'd like to have you go along.'</p>

<p>"The invitation was promptly accepted.</p>

<p>"On the way to the farmhouse the lawyer and the printer
chatted delightfully, cementing a friendship that was fast
ripening into real affection. Arriving at the house, the woman
was found to be near her end.</p>

<p>"With great gentleness Lincoln drew up the document
disposing of the property as the woman desired. Neighbors
and relatives were present, making it unnecessary to call on
Greene to witness the instrument. After the signing and
witnessing of the will the woman turned to Lincoln and said,
with a smile:</p>

<p>"'Now I have my affairs for this world arranged satisfactorily.
I am thankful to say that long before this I have
made preparation for the other life I am so soon to enter.
Many years ago I sought and found Christ as my Saviour.
He has been my stay and comfort through the years, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
now near to carry me over the river of death. I do not fear
death, Mr. Lincoln. I am really glad that my time has come,
for loved ones have gone before me and I rejoice in the
hope of meeting them so soon.'</p>

<p>"Instinctively the friends drew nearer the bedside. As
the dying woman had addressed her words more directly to
Lincoln than to the others, Lincoln, evincing sympathy in
every look and gesture, bent toward her and said:</p>

<p>"'Your faith in Christ is wise and strong; your hope of a
future life is blessed. You are to be congratulated in passing
through life so usefully, and into the life beyond so hopefully.'</p>

<p>"'Mr. Lincoln,' said she, 'won't you read a few verses
out of the Bible for me?'</p>

<p>"A member of the family offered him the family Bible.
Instead of taking it, he began reciting from memory the
twenty-third Psalm, laying emphasis upon 'Though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.'
Still without referring to the Bible, Lincoln began with the
first part of the fourteenth chapter of John:</p>

<p>"'Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe

<p>"'In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were
not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</p>

<p>"'And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there
ye may be also.'</p>

<p>"After he had given these and other quotations from the
Scriptures, he recited various familiar comforting hymns,
closing with 'Rock of Ages, cleft for me.' Then, with a tenderness
and pathos that enthralled everyone in the room, he
spoke the last stanza&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>While I draw this fleeting breath,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>When mine eyes shall close in death,</i></span><br />

<span class="i0"><i>See Thee on Thy judgment throne,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</i></span><br />

<p>"While Lincoln was reciting this stanza a look of peace
and resignation lit up the countenance of the dying woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
In a few minutes more, while the lawyer and the printer were
there, she passed away.</p>

<p>"The journey back to Springfield was begun in silence.
It was the younger man who finally said:</p>

<p>"'Mr. Lincoln, ever since what has just happened back
there in the farmhouse, I have been thinking that it is very
extraordinary that you should so perfectly have acted as
pastor as well as attorney.'</p>

<p>"When the answer to this suggestion finally was given&mdash;and
it was not given at once&mdash;Lincoln said:</p>

<p>"'God, and Eternity, and Heaven were very near to me
today.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles T. White</span>, <i>Lincoln the Comforter</i>,
pp. 11-16.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reference should be made in our review of this period to
Lincoln's stories as exhibiting an important phase of his
character.</p>

<p>It is not easy to decide what stories actually were Lincoln's.
Very few of them are to be found in their original
setting, for he did not commonly tell stories when he made
speeches. They were told in personal interviews, in hours of
recreation, and especially in taverns and other loafing places.
The period of their greatest vogue was that in which Lincoln
traveled the circuit. Most of the successful lawyers of that
day were story-tellers; and in the evenings of court-week they
swapped yarns with local wits. Lincoln was the most famous
of a considerable group of noted Illinois story-tellers.</p>

<p>During his lifetime he was asked about how many of the
stories attributed to him were his own, and he said he thought
about half. A much larger discount would need to be made
now. Many such stories Lincoln probably never heard.</p>

<p>The stories which lawyers told to each other and to groups
of men were not all of them overnice; and Lincoln's stories
were like the rest. He did not always confine himself to
strictly proper stories. But in those that are authentic and not
quite proper, it is to be observed that the coarseness was incidental
to the real point of the story. I have not heard any
story, authenticated as Lincoln's, which is actually obscene.</p>

<p>It has been my privilege to examine a considerable quan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tity
of unpublished writing of Lincoln's, including some manuscripts
that have been withheld for the reason that they were
not quite proper. Of these I can say that they are few in
number, and that the element of vulgarity is very small.
Excepting only the "First Chronicles of Reuben," which was
a rude backwoods joke, written in his boyhood, and in full
accord with the standards of humor current in the time and
general environment, there is not very much that one could
wish had been destroyed.</p>

<p>The frankest piece of questionable literature from Lincoln's
pen in mature years, so far as I am aware, is in a private
collection, and its owner does not permit it to be copied. Not
many people are permitted to see it. It is probably the least
attractive scrap of Lincoln's writing extant that dates from
his mature years. It is undated, but belongs to the period of
his life on the circuit. It is a piece of extravagant nonsense,
written in about twenty lines on a quarter sheet of legal cap,
and is probably the effort to recall and record something that
he had heard and which amused him. Its whole point is in
the transposition of the initial letters of compound words, or
words in juxtaposition in a sentence, such as a speaker sometimes
makes in a moment of mental confusion. Thus a
cotton-patch is a "potten-catch" and a fence-corner is a
"cence-forner." Every clause contains one or more of these
absurdities, until a sense of boisterous mirth is awakened at
the possibility that there should be so many of them. Most of
them are harmless as the two above quoted, but there are two
or three that are not in good taste. They are not vile nor
obscene, but not very pretty. Lincoln wasted ten minutes of
spare time in writing out this rather ingenious bit of nonsense,
and it is not worth more than that length of discussion.
It is probably the worst bit of extant writing of Lincoln's
mature years, written in the period of his circuit-riding, and
it has little to commend it and not a great deal to condemn.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Lincoln's religious life in Springfield has been and is
the subject of violent controversy. Much that has been written
on both sides bears the marks of prejudice and exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
internal evidence of having been consciously or unconsciously
distorted. In a later chapter it will come before us for
review and analysis. Of it we may now remind ourselves
that in this period covering nearly a quarter of a century
Lincoln was developing in many ways. He emerged from
grinding poverty into a condition in which he owned a home
and had a modest sum of money in the bank. From an ill-trained
fledgling lawyer, compelled by his poverty to share
a bed in a friend's room above the store, he had come to be a
leader at the Illinois bar. From an obscure figure in State
politics he had come to be the recognized leader of a political
party that was destined to achieve national success and to
determine the policies of the nation with little interruption
for more than half a century. Out of a condition of great
mental uncertainty in all matters relating to domestic relations
he had come into a settled condition as the husband of a brilliant
and ambitious woman and the father of a family of
sons to whom he was devotedly attached. For the first time
in his life he lived in a community where there were buildings
wholly dedicated to the purposes of public worship; and after
a considerable period of non-church attendance, and perhaps
another of infrequent or irregular attendance, he had become
a regular attendant and supporter of a church whose minister
was his personal friend and whom he greatly admired.</p>

<p>During his years in Springfield, Mr. Lincoln's political
ideals had undergone marked change. His experience in the
Illinois Legislature is not discreditable; neither does it manifest
any notably high ideals. Nor was he brilliantly successful in
his one term in Congress. Lincoln was an honest politician,
in the sense that he kept his promises and stood by his announced
convictions. But it is impossible to read into his
legislative history any such lofty purpose as later possessed
him. He and the other members of the "Long Nine" log-rolled
in orthodox political fashion, and won from Governor
Ford the title "spared monuments of popular wrath."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>As a jury lawyer, also, his arts were those of the successful
trial lawyer of the period. So far as the author has been
able to find, there was no unworthy chapter in all this long
history. The story, for instance, that in the trial of Armstrong
Lincoln used an almanac of another year and won his
case by fraud, has, as the author is convinced, no foundation
whatever in fact. On the contrary, Lincoln was at a serious
disadvantage in any case in whose justice he did not fully
believe.</p>

<p>But there came a time when Lincoln was more than a
shrewd and honest politician; more than a successful jury
lawyer. In the brief autobiographical sketch which he prepared
for Mr. Fell, he speaks of his work at the end of his
term in Congress, and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress.
Was not a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to
1854, both inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever
before. Always a Whig in politics, and generally on the
Whig electoral tickets, making active canvasses, I was losing
interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise
aroused me again. What I have done since is pretty
well known."</p></blockquote>

<p>He expanded this brief statement somewhat in the sketch
which he furnished a little later to Scripps as a basis of his
campaign biography:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Upon his return from Congress, he went to the practice
of the law with greater earnestness than ever before....
In 1854 his profession had almost superseded the thought of
politics in his mind, when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise
aroused him as he had never been before."</p></blockquote>

<p>The full effect of this unprecedented arousing was manifest
in his speech at Springfield on June 16, 1858, the "House-Divided-Against-Itself"
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Lincoln himself is our authority for the statement that
the moral aspects of the slavery issue called him back into
politics and roused him as he never before had been aroused.
Politically, at least, Abraham Lincoln had been born again.
Nor had it been a period of spiritual inaction or retrogression,
as we have seen and shall see yet further.</p>

<p>In addition to all this he had known the discipline of
sorrow, and had had occasion to test religion on the practical
side of its availability for comfort in time of bereavement.
He had now been chosen to a position of responsibility such
as no man in all the history of his nation had ever been called
upon to occupy.</p>

<p>On the day before he was fifty-two years old he stood
upon the platform of a railroad train ready to leave Springfield
for the last time. He did not know that it was the last
time, but he had a haunting presentiment that it might be so.
With tears filling his eyes and in a voice choked with emotion
he spoke his last words to his neighbors and friends. Just
what he said we shall never know. A shorthand reporter
endeavored to write it down, but with indifferent success.
Hon. Newton Bateman, State Superintendent of Schools, of
whom we shall hear later, hurried to his office after the train
pulled out and wrote down what, judged by any reasonable
test, must be considered a very satisfactory report of it.
Lincoln sat down in the train after it had left Springfield and
endeavored to recall the exact language which he had used,
and in this was assisted by his private secretary, John Hay.
Of these three, and a considerable number of other versions,
the Illinois Historical Society has chosen the third as the
authentic version. It represents what Lincoln wished to be
remembered as having said, and very nearly what he actually
did say. This version of his farewell address, representing
the deep feeling of his heart at the hour of parting, and
recorded on the same day as embodying his deliberate revision
of the extempore utterance, is taken from Nicolay and Hay's
edition of his Life and of his Works. It is that which was
cast in bronze and placed in the year of his Centennial, in
front of the State House at Springfield. If one would meas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ure
the growth of Abraham Lincoln intellectually and spiritually
he might ask, What kind of an address in comparison
with this Lincoln might have delivered on his departure from
Kentucky in 1816, from Indiana in 1830, or from New Salem
in 1837? The answer is so emphatic as almost to make the
question absurd; but it is worth while to ask the question
before we read again the familiar words of his farewell
address. No one reading these few sentences can question
the sincerity of Lincoln's utterance or the depth of his religious
feeling:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My friends: No one, not in my situation, can appreciate
my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the
kindness of these people, I owe everything. Here I have
lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a youth
to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is
buried. I now leave, not knowing when or whether ever I
may return, with the task before me greater than that which
rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that
Divine Being who ever attended him I cannot succeed. With
that assistance, I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go
with me, and remain with you and be everywhere for good,
let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care
commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend
me, I bid you an affectionate farewell."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicolay and Hay</span>,
III, 291.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE ENVIRONMENT OF LINCOLN'S LIFE IN<br />
WASHINGTON</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span> was inaugurated sixteenth president of
the United States, on Monday, March 4, 1861. His journey
to Washington had served to impress him even more deeply
than before with a sense of the solemnity of his task. He
still was earnestly hoping, and if we may judge from his
speeches along the route, even expecting, that war would be
averted;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but the possibility of war was always apparent and
its probability was growing daily more certain.</p>

<p>Several incidents are related tending to show the solemnity
of Lincoln's feeling at this time. Some of them are plainly
apocryphal, but others are deeply significant. The following
was related by Rev. Dr. Miner, pastor of the First Baptist
Church of Springfield, who was intimately acquainted with the
Lincoln family and who visited them in the White House.
This story he declared was related to him by Mrs. Lincoln
on the occasion of his visit to the White House and was published
while Mrs. Lincoln was still living. It appears to rest
upon a sound basis of fact:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here I relate an incident which occurred on the 4th of
March, 1861, as told me by Mrs. Lincoln. Said she:</p>

<p>"'Mr. Lincoln wrote the conclusion of his inaugural address
the morning it was delivered. The family being present,
he read it to them. He then said he wished to be left alone for
a short time. The family retired to an adjoining room, but not
so far distant but that the voice of prayer could be distinctly
heard. There, closeted with God alone, surrounded by the
enemies who were ready to take his life, he commended his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
country's cause and all dear to him to God's providential care,
and with a mind calmed by communion with his Father in
heaven, and courage equal to the danger, he came forth from
that retirement ready for duty.'"&mdash;<i>Scribner's Monthly</i>, 1873,
p. 343.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fort Sumter fell April 13, and on the 15th Lincoln issued
his call for volunteers, and called Congress in extraordinary
session for July 4. On July 21 occurred the battle of Bull
Run, and the war settled down to its weary and varying fortunes.
On September 22, 1862, he issued the Emancipation
Proclamation to take effect January 1, 1863. The battle of
Gettysburg occurred July 1-4, 1863, and destroyed the hope
of the Southern Army of a successful invasion of the North.
Simultaneously with Lee's defeat at Gettysburg, General Grant
captured Vicksburg, opening the Mississippi to the Union gunboats.
On November 19, 1863, Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg
address. On March 4, 1865, he was inaugurated President
a second time. On Sunday, April 9, 1865, General Lee
surrendered his army at Appomattox. On Friday night, April
14, at 10:20 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, Abraham Lincoln was shot in Ford's Theater
and died on Saturday morning, April 15, at 7:22. On Thursday,
May 4, his body was interred at Oak Ridge Cemetery in
Springfield.</p>

<p>During his residence in Washington, Mr. Lincoln habitually
attended the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church.
He was a warm personal friend of the pastor, Rev. Phineas D.
Gurley, D.D., whose grandson, Captain Gurley of the War
Department, relates that Lincoln sat with Dr. Gurley on the
rear porch of the White House during the second battle of
Bull Run, and when the strain had become almost unbearable
he knelt in prayer and Mr. Lincoln knelt beside him and joined
reverently in the petition. Dr. Gurley's testimonies to the
religious development of Lincoln's life were conservative, and
bear upon their face marks of trustworthiness. There are no
extravagant claims; no florid and declamatory theological
affirmations,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> but such as this which Dr. Gurley remembers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to have heard Lincoln say to a company of clergymen calling
upon him in one of the darkest times in the Civil War:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My hope of success in this struggle rests on that immutable
foundation, the justness and the goodness of God;
and when events are very threatening I still hope that in some
way all will be well in the end, because our cause is just and
God will be on our side."&mdash;<i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, 1873, p. 339.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln sometimes varied this form of expression and said
that he was less anxious to proclaim that God was on his side
than he was to be sure that he was on God's side.</p>

<p>During this period Lincoln had frequent occasion to meet
delegations from religious bodies and to reply to their addresses.
We shall have occasion later to consider some of his
words to these different religious bodies. He also issued a
number of proclamations, calling for days of fasting and
prayer and days of thanksgiving, in which he expressed not
only the formal sentiment which he might assume represented
the mind of the people, but also to a considerable extent what
must have been his own religious conviction.</p>

<p>An unbiased reading of these proclamations and addresses
compels the reader to recognize in them, not merely the formal
courtesy of an official to the representatives of large and
influential bodies, but the sincere expression of his own faith.
An illustration may be found in his attitude toward the
Quakers. No religious body suffered more during the Civil
War, and with no religious fellowship did Mr. Lincoln feel a
more instinctive sympathy, though he was compelled by the
logic of events to pursue courses of action in contravention of
their desires and at times of their convictions.</p>

<p>In September, 1862, he received a delegation of Friends,
and listened to an address on their behalf by Mrs. Eliza P.
Gurney, wife of Joseph John Gurney, a wealthy banker, entreating
him on behalf of their peace-loving organization to
bring the war to a speedy end. He could not do what they
wished, and moreover, he believed that it was not the will of
God that the war should end till it had wrought out the purposes
of the Divine will. He said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am glad of this interview, and glad to know that I have
your sympathy and prayers. We are indeed going through a
great trial&mdash;a fiery trial. In the very responsible position in
which I happen to be placed, being a humble instrument in the
hands of our Heavenly Father, as I am, and as we all are,
to work out His great purposes, I have desired that all my
works and acts may be according to His will, and that it might
be so, I have sought His aid; but if, after endeavoring to do
my best in the light which He affords me, I find my efforts
fail, I must believe that for some purpose unknown to me, He
wills it otherwise. If I had had my way, this war would never
have been commenced. If I had been allowed my way, this
war would have been ended before this; but we find it still
continues, and we must believe that He permits it for some
wise purpose of His own, mysterious and unknown to us; and
though with our limited understandings we may not be able to
comprehend it, yet we cannot but believe that He who made
the world still governs it."</p></blockquote>

<p>We are not permitted to believe that on this and similar
occasions Mr. Lincoln met the situation with words of pious
evasion, or that what he said was simply what he thought he
might be expected to say. Some months after this interview
Mrs. Gurney, being then in London, wrote to Mr. Lincoln.
He could easily have acknowledged the letter without committing
himself to any religious expression. For several
months he kept the letter, and then, on September 4, 1864,
he wrote to her as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My esteemed Friend: I have not forgotten&mdash;probably
never shall forget&mdash;the very impressive occasion when yourself
and friends visited me on a Sabbath forenoon two years
ago. Nor has your kind letter, written nearly a year later,
ever been forgotten. In all it has been your purpose to
strengthen my reliance on God. I am much indebted to the
good Christian people of the country for their constant prayers
and consolations; and to no one of them more than to yourself.
The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail,
though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive them
in advance. We hoped for a happy termination of this terrible
war long before this; but God knows best and ruled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
otherwise. We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom, and our
own error therein. Meanwhile we must work earnestly in the
best light He gives us, trusting that so working still conduces
to the great ends He ordains. Surely He intends some great
good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal could
make, and no mortal could stay. Your people, the Friends,
have had, and are having, a very great trial. On principle and
faith opposed to both war and oppression, they can only practically
oppose oppression by war. In this hard dilemma some
have chosen one horn, and some the other. For those appealing
to me on conscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do,
the best I could and can, in my own conscience, under my
oath to the law. That you believe this, I doubt not, and believing
it, I shall receive for my country and myself your earnest
prayers to our Father in Heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Lincoln's habit of public worship during his Presidency,
Rev. William Henry Roberts, Stated Clerk of the Presbyterian
General Assembly, writes in a foreword to Dr. Johnson's book:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was my privilege as a young man to have known
Abraham Lincoln. Entering the service of the United States
government in the fall of 1863, the first Sabbath of my
sojourn in Washington City I went to the New York Avenue
Presbyterian Church. When the time for the long prayer
came, according to immemorial usage in many Presbyterian
congregations, a number of the men stood up for prayer, and
among those upright figures I noticed in particular that of the
President of the United States. As a member of the New
York Avenue Church I was seated not far from Mr. Lincoln at
Sunday services for a year and a half, and his attitude was
always that of an earnest and devout worshiper. He was also
an attendant at the weekly meeting, though for a considerable
period taking part in the services privately. It having become
known that he was an attendant at the prayer meeting, many
persons would gather in or near the church at the close of the
service in order to have access to him for various purposes.
Desiring to put an end to these unwelcome interruptions, the
Rev. Dr. Phineas D. Gurley, the pastor of Mr. Lincoln, arranged
to have the President sit in the pastor's room, the door
of which opened upon the lecture room, and there Mr. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
would take a silent part in the service. He informed his
pastor on several occasions that he had received great comfort
from the meetings, and for the reason that they had been
characterized more by prayer than by the making of addresses.</p>

<p>"Dr. Gurley bore repeated testimony to myself and to other
members of the church of the deeply religious character of
Mr. Lincoln, and it is with pleasure that I add this brief testimony
from my own experience and observation.</p>

<p>"It will be fifty years next fall since I came into direct
touch with the man, who in the providence of God was the
liberator of a race, and I shall always hold in sweet and blessed
memory my first sight of him, as a devout worshiper standing
for prayer in the sanctuary of the Most High."&mdash;<i>Abraham
Lincoln the Christian</i>, pp. 13-15.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have copied direct from the original letter, in possession
of Mr. Jesse W. Weik, Nicolay's letter to Herndon affirming
that, to the best of his knowledge, Lincoln's belief did not
change during his years in the White House. It was addressed
to Herndon, and it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
"Executive Mansion,<br />
"Washington, May 27, 1865.</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Friend Herndon</span>:&mdash;
</p>

<p>"I have this morning received your note of the 23rd inst.
and reply at once.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln did not, to my knowledge, change in any
way his religious views, beliefs, or opinions from the time he
left Springfield to the day of his death. I do not know just
what they were, never having heard him explain them in
detail; but I am very sure he gave no outward indication of
his mind having undergone any change in that regard while
here.</p>

<p class="c">
"Very truly,</p>
<p class="r">"<span class="smcap">Jno. G. Nicolay</span>.</p>
<p class="l">
"<span class="smcap">Hon. William H. Herndon.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>While Nicolay's declaration that Lincoln gave no outward
indication that his views had undergone any change during his
residence in the White House is entitled to great weight, it is
not wholly conclusive. It is quite possible that Mr. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
changed more than those who were closest to him every day
realized, more, indeed, than he himself realized. Some men
who had known him in earlier years and who met him from
time to time while he was in the White House observed a
change too subtle to be fully realized by those who saw him
daily. Joshua Fry Speed knew Lincoln from the day Lincoln
arrived in Springfield until his death. Indeed, he had known
Lincoln earlier; but their intimate acquaintance began on the
day when Lincoln received his law license and moved to Springfield,
where he shared Speed's bed. Speed told of that incident
frequently, how Lincoln came into his store, greatly depressed,
asking to be permitted to purchase a single bed which
he was not certain he could ever pay for; but Speed invited
Lincoln to sleep with him in the room above the store. Lincoln
carried his saddlebags upstairs and set them down, and came
down the stairs with his countenance beaming, as he said,
"Well, Speed, I've moved!" Lamon declares that Speed was
"The most intimate friend Mr. Lincoln ever had at this or any
other time" (<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 231). Says Lamon: "He
made to Speed the most confidential communications he ever
made to mortal man. If he had on earth 'a bosom crony,' it
was Speed, and that deep and abiding attachment subsisted
unimpaired to the day of Lincoln's death." To Speed alone
Lincoln gave his full confidence in the matter of his love affairs,
and they talked together as men seldom talk to each
other. Speaking out of a most intimate knowledge, Speed
wrote in his lecture on Lincoln:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have often been asked what were Mr. Lincoln's religious
opinions. When I knew him in early life, he was a skeptic.
He had tried hard to be a believer, but his reason could not
grasp and solve the great problem of redemption as taught.
He was very cautious never to give expression to any thought
or sentiment that would grate harshly upon a Christian ear.
For a sincere Christian he had great respect. He often said
that the most ambitious man might live to see every hope fail;
but no Christian could live and see his hope fail, because fulfillment
could only come when life ended. But this was a
subject we never discussed. The only evidence I have of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
change, was in the summer before he was killed. I was invited
out to the Soldiers' Home to spend the night. As I entered
the room, near night, he was sitting near a window intently
reading his Bible. Approaching him I said, 'I am glad to
see you so profitably engaged.' 'Yes,' said he, 'I am profitably
engaged.' 'Well,' said I, 'if you have recovered from
your skepticism, I am sorry to say that I have not.' Looking
me earnestly in the face, and placing his hand on my shoulder,
he said, 'You are wrong, Speed; take all of this Book upon
reason that you can, and the balance on faith, and you will live
and die a happier man.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Speed</span>: <i>Lecture on Abraham Lincoln</i>,
pp. 32, 33.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bible which the colored people presented to Lincoln
was kept and prized by him. Hon. H. C. Deming, in his
address before the Legislature of Connecticut, just after Lincoln's
death, referred to it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The interview which I am recalling was last summer
[1864] just after General Fremont had declined to run against
him for the Presidency. The magnificent Bible, which the
negroes of Washington<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> had just presented to him lay upon
the table, and while we were both examining it, I recited the
somewhat remarkable passage from the Chronicles, 'Eastward
were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a
day, and toward Assuppim two and two. At Parbar westward,
four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.'<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He immediately
challenged me to find any such passage as that in
<i>his</i> Bible. After I had pointed it out to him, and he was
satisfied of its genuineness, he asked me if I remembered the
text which his friends had applied to Fremont, and instantly
turned to a verse in the first of Samuel, put on his spectacles,
and read in his slow, peculiar, and waggish tone,&mdash;'And
everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt,
and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with
him about four hundred men.'"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There are two interesting facts about this incident related
by Representative Deming. One is that Lincoln knew his
Bible well enough to challenge an unfamiliar passage and require
that it be shown to him before believing that the Bible
contained it. Only a man who had read his Bible much
would have been so confident. The other is that this story
recalled to Mr. Deming that very important declaration of
Lincoln which is attested by a number of other credible witnesses
in substance, but which Deming first gave to the world
in his notable address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am here reminded of an impressive remark which he
made to me upon another occasion, and which I shall never
forget. He said, he had never united himself to any church,
because he found difficulty in giving his assent, without mental
reservations, to the long complicated statements of Christian
doctrine which characterize their Articles of Belief and Confessions
of Faith. 'When any church,' he continued, 'will
inscribe over its altar as its sole qualification for membership
the Saviour's condensed statement of the substance of both
the law and Gospel, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,
and thy neighbor as thyself,&mdash;that church will I join with all
my heart and soul.'"&mdash;<i>Eulogy upon Abraham Lincoln, before
the General Assembly of Connecticut, 1865</i>, p. 42.</p></blockquote>

<p>Henry C. Whitney knew Lincoln well, from the days of
their circuit riding in Illinois till Lincoln's death. His testimony
is valuable:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln was a fatalist: he believed, and often said,
that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Rough-hew them how we will,'</i></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>and as a corollary from this belief, that the Almighty controlled
the affairs of men and made the wrath of men to praise Him.
In all stages of his administration and before, commencing
with his first public utterance after his election, he declared
that with God's help he should succeed, and without it he would
fail. Likewise, before he was run for the Presidency, he made
frequent references to God in the same spirit of devoutness and
trust; and, therefore, he was honest; honest with his Father
on his dying bed, honest in what he feared was (and which
proved to be) his last affectionate farewell to his neighbors,
honest to the many eminent bands of clergymen and Christian
people who visited him, and honest with his Cabinet in the
most important consultation it ever held; then Lincoln, whether
as man or as President, believed in God as the Ruler of the
Universe, in a blessed hereafter, and in the efficacy of prayer.
. . . Mr. Lincoln believed himself to be an instrument of
God; and that, as God willed, so would the contest be. He
also believed in prayer and its efficacy, and that God willed the
destruction of slavery through his instrumentality, and he believed
in the Church of God as an important auxiliary."&mdash;<i>Life
on the Circuit with Lincoln</i>, pp. 267-68.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the men in Washington who best knew the mind
of Abraham Lincoln was Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, and afterward Vice-President under
General Grant. In his memorial address delivered just after
the assassination, he paid a high tribute to the deep religious
spirit of Lincoln as he knew it, and said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor should I forget to mention that the last Act of Congress
signed by him was one requiring that the motto, in which
he sincerely believed, 'In God we trust' should hereafter be
inscribed upon all our national coins."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hon. Schuyler
Colfax</span>, in <i>Memorial Address in Chicago, April 30, 1865</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>During his residence in the White House Mr. Lincoln
again met the discipline of personal bereavement. His son
Willie died. There is conflict of testimony as to Mr. Lincoln's
love for his wife, though the present writer believes that
he truly loved her, but no one who knew him ever doubted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
devotion to his children. The death of this little boy, William
Wallace, who was born in Springfield, December 21, 1850, and
died in the White House, February 20, 1862, seemed, according
to the testimony of Mrs. Lincoln, to turn his thoughts
more to religion. It must have recalled to him all that had
occurred when his other boy died in Springfield, and it brought
new and solemn thoughts and possibly convictions.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was now father to the boys of a nation.
They were marching at his order, singing,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>We are coming, Father Abraham,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Six hundred thousand more.</i>"</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They were laying down their young lives for a cause that he
told them was holy. How he felt for the fathers and mothers
of the land, his letter to Mrs. Bixby and his countless deeds of
mercy testify. Again and again, as Ingersoll well said, he
abused his great power on the side of mercy and never otherwise.
The deepening sense of responsibility, as he affirmed,
again and again drove him to his knees (Noah Brooks in
<i>Harper's Monthly</i> for July, 1885). Did he consciously change
his theology? Very likely not; but he certainly became a more
and more deeply religious man under the discipline of these
experiences.</p>

<p>Perhaps more than all else, the moral aspects of the slavery
question thrust themselves into a foremost place in his religious
thinking. We need not trouble ourselves overmuch about the
accuracy of John Hanks's story that when Lincoln saw slaves
sold in the market in New Orleans he vowed to "hit that
institution and hit it hard"; part of that story may have
originated in John's fertile imagination. But the story is not
an unworthy one, and we know from Lincoln's own declaration
that on that very occasion he was smitten with a sense of
the iniquity of slavery, and that on its moral rather than its
political side. That he freed the slaves as a war measure, and
that he must thus justify the action as an extra-constitutional
prerogative, need not lessen in our mind the moral aspects of
the decision. The evidence is incontestable, and we shall quote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it later, that to him it was a solemn obligation, the fulfillment
of a vow which he had made to God.</p>

<p>We are presently to go into a detailed examination of the
available evidence concerning Lincoln's religious life. We are
here considering his environment in the successive stages of
his career, and his visible reaction to it. But even if we were
to go no further, we should find ourselves compelled to believe
in the reality of Lincoln's religion. We might not be able
accurately to define it, and we may not be able to do so to
our complete satisfaction after we have finished; we might
even question, and we may still question, whether he himself
ever fully defined it. But we are assured that his religion was
real and genuine, and that it grew more vital as he faced more
completely the moral and spiritual aspects of the work to
which, as he honestly believed, he was divinely called.</p>

<p>When General Lee surrendered his armies on April 9, 1865,
Mr. Stanton, Secretary of War, though not a very religious
man in his profession, felt with the whole nation the Providence
of God in the result. He surrounded the dome of the
Capitol with a transparency, reading, "This is the Lord's
doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes."</p>

<p>He believed it; the nation believed it; Abraham Lincoln
believed it. That conviction that the hand of God had been in
it all had but lately been expressed in his Second Inaugural.
That faith was warm in his heart, and its expression fresh
upon his lips, when on April 14, 1865, he was shot and killed.</p>

<p>So ended the earthly life of Abraham Lincoln; and with
that end came the beginning of the discussion of his religion.
To the history of that discussion, and the critical consideration
of the evidence which it adduced, we are now to address ourselves.</p>

<p class="ph2">PART II: AN ANALYSIS OF THE<br />
EVIDENCE</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="c">THE RULES OF EVIDENCE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> far we have dealt primarily with the environments of
Lincoln's religious life. We have not been able to escape the
conviction that Lincoln's religious life was an evolution, influenced
by his environment and experience. We have considered
in these successive chapters some matters in detail which
seemed to belong particularly to the respective periods of which
those chapters have treated; but we have reserved, in general,
the evidence that bears upon his religion as a whole for more
critical examination. Particularly have we reserved those portions
of the evidence which, first published after his death,
belong to no one epoch of his life and have become the occasion
of controversy. What kind of man he was religiously in 1865
we shall hope to know better; indeed, it is not unreasonable
to hope that examination may show in part the processes by
which his religion found its final form and expression.</p>

<p>We know already that there had been a development. We
know that the Abraham Lincoln who in 1834 delivered his
political opinions in labored and florid style and with the logic
current in stump oratory had undergone mental development
and had emerged into the Lincoln who delivered his thoughts
in translucent Anglo-Saxon at Gettysburg and the Second Inaugural.
That there had been a moral and spiritual development
also we have already been assured. Perhaps it was
greater than he himself consciously understood. We shall now
endeavor to ascertain what it had come to be.</p>

<p>In this inquiry we have no easy task. The mass of evidence
is great, and the contradictions are many. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
contradictions in the personality of the man himself, and many
contradictions in the views which men, even honest and unprejudiced
men, had of him; and not all the testimony is
unprejudiced.</p>

<p>Lincoln was a man of many moods. He reacted differently
to different stimuli, and to the same stimulus at different times.
His feelings ran the gamut from abysmal dejection to rollicking
gaiety: and he never revealed his whole nature to any one
man, nor showed the whole of his nature at any one time.
He cannot be judged by the mechanical tests of a rigid consistency:
for he was not that kind of man.</p>

<p>When Dr. J. G. Holland went to Springfield immediately
after the death of Lincoln to gather material for his biography
he was surprised beyond measure to find how conflicting were
the local judgments of Lincoln's character. Concerning this
he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such a nature and character seem full of contradictions;
and a man who is subject to such transitions will always be
a mystery to those who do not know him wholly. Thus no
two men among his intimate friends will agree concerning him.</p>

<p>"The writer has conversed with multitudes of men who
claimed to know Mr. Lincoln intimately; yet there are not two
of the whole number who agree in their estimate of him. The
fact was that he rarely showed more than one aspect of himself
to one man. He opened himself to men in different directions.
It was rare that he exhibited what was religious in him; and
he never did this at all, except when he found just the nature
and character that were sympathetic with that aspect and element
of his character. A great deal of his best, deepest, largest
life he kept almost constantly from view, because he would not
expose it to the eyes and apprehension of the careless multitude.</p>

<p>"To illustrate the effect of the peculiarity of Mr. Lincoln's
intercourse with men, it may be said that men who knew him
through all his professional and political life have offered
opinions as diametrically opposite as these, viz.: that he was a
very ambitious man, and that he was without a particle of
ambition; that he was one of the saddest men that ever lived,
and that he was one of the jolliest men that ever lived; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
he was very religious, but that he was not a Christian; that
he was a Christian, but did not know it; that he was so far
from being a religious man or a Christian that 'the less said
upon the subject the better'; that he was the most cunning
man in America, and that he had not a particle of cunning in
him; that he had the strongest personal attachments, and that
he had no personal attachments at all&mdash;only a general good
feeling toward everybody; that he was a man of indomitable
will, and that he was a man almost without a will; that he
was a tyrant, and that he was the softest-hearted, most
brotherly man that ever lived; that he was remarkable for his
pure-mindedness, and that he was the foulest in his jests and
stories of any man in the country; that he was a witty man,
and that he was only a retailer of the wit of others; that his
apparent candor and fairness were only apparent, and that they
were as real as his head and his hands; that he was a boor,
and that he was in all essential respects a gentleman; that he
was a leader of the people, and that he was always led by
the people; that he was cool and impassive, and that he was
susceptible of the strongest passions. It is only by tracing
these separate streams of impression back to their fountain
that we are able to arrive at anything like a competent comprehension
of the man, or to learn why he came to be held in such
various estimation. Men caught only separate aspects of his
character&mdash;only the fragments that were called into exhibition
by their own qualities."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holland</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, pp.
241-42.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some writers, and more orators, have professed to see in
the character of Lincoln a perfect balancing of all desirable
qualities. Bishop Fowler, in what was perhaps the most widely
popular of all popular orations on Lincoln, attributed his own
inability to analyze the character of Lincoln to its perfect
sphericity, a consistency such that any attempt to consider any
quality by itself met the counterbalancing consideration of all
the other qualities. But the antitheses in Lincoln's character
were not those of a perfect consistency.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They were of a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
which puzzled those who knew him best, and were most easily
explained by those who gave least study to the man himself
and most to their own theories of what a man like Mr. Lincoln
must have been.</p>

<p>Of these sharp antitheses in Lincoln's character, Col. Clark
E. Carr, who knew him well, said in an address which I
heard:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Abraham Lincoln was the drollest man I ever saw.</p>

<p>"He could make a cat laugh. Never was another man
so vivacious; never have I seen another who provoked so much
mirth, and who entered into rollicking fun with such glee.
He was the most comical and jocose of human beings, laughing
with the same zest at his own jokes as at those of others.
I did not wonder that, while actively engaged in party politics,
his opponents who had seen him in these moods called Abraham
Lincoln a clown and an ape.</p>

<p>"Abraham Lincoln was the most serious man I ever saw.</p>

<p>"When I heard him protest against blighting our new
territories with the curse of human slavery, in his debates with
Senator Douglas, no man could have been more in earnest,
none more serious. In his analysis of legal problems, whether
in the practice of his profession or in the consideration of
State papers, he became wholly absorbed in his subject. Sometimes
he lapsed into reverie and communed with his own
thoughts, noting nothing that was going on about him until
aroused, when perhaps he would enter into a discussion of the
subject that had occupied his mind, or perhaps break out into
laughter and tell a joke or story that set the table in a roar.</p>

<p>"When I saw him at Gettysburg as he exclaimed, 'That
we here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in
vain; that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of
freedom, and that the government of the people, by the people,
and for the people, shall not perish from the earth!'&mdash;when I
heard him declare in his second inaugural address, 'Fondly do
we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it continue
until all the wealth piled up by the bondman's two hundred
and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until
every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by
another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand
years, so still it must be said, "the judgments of the Lord are
true and righteous altogether."... With malice toward
none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God
gives us to see the right,'&mdash;as I looked upon him and heard
him utter these sentiments, upon these occasions, Abraham
Lincoln was the most solemn, the most dignified, the most
majestic, and at the same time the most benignant human
being I ever saw.</p>

<p>"Rochefoucauld says that 'Gravity is a mystery of the
body invented to conceal defects of the mind.' Lord Shaftesbury
says that 'Gravity is the very essence of imposture.'
Abraham Lincoln had none of this.</p>

<p>"Man is the most serious of animals. Man is the most
frivolous of animals. It is said that man is the only animal
that can both laugh and cry. Abraham Lincoln gave full vent
to his emotions. He went through life with no restraints nor
manacles upon his human nature. He was honest in the expression
of his feelings, whether serious or otherwise, honest
in their manifestation, honest with himself.</p>

<p>"It was because Abraham Lincoln was the most human of
human beings that he is loved as has never been any other
man that ever lived."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clark E. Carr</span>: <i>My Day and Generation</i>,
pp. 107-9.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was much reason for this wide disparity of opinion
in the varying moods of Lincoln himself, and the contrary
aspects of his personality. But this was not the sole reason.
Springfield itself was greatly divided concerning Mr. Lincoln.
There were lawyers who had been on opposing sides of cases
against him and had sometimes won them. There were all the
petty animosities which grow up in a small city. Furthermore,
Springfield was moderately full of disappointed people who
had expected that their friendship for Lincoln would have
procured for them some political appointment. Any political
aspirant living in Maine or Missouri who had a fourth cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
living in Springfield and possessed of a speaking acquaintance
with Mr. Lincoln, felt that he and his kinsfolk suffered an
unmerited discourtesy if Mr. Lincoln through such influence
did not produce on application a commission as Major-General
or an appointment as Ambassador to some foreign court.</p>

<p>We have a yet further difficulty to face in the conflict of
testimony of habitually truthful people. If it were becoming
in the author of a book such as this to pass any general criticism
upon those authors who have preceded him in the same
field, it might, perhaps, be counted not invidious to say that
for the most part writers on the religion of Lincoln have been
content to adduce the testimony of a limited number of apparently
truthful witnesses in support of their theory, but have
not given the evidence very much examination beyond the
general fact that the witnesses were habitually truthful people.
We shall not arrive at the truth in this fashion.</p>

<p>We may borrow an illustration from a field which lies
just outside the scope of our present inquiry. Even to this
day it is possible to start a warm discussion almost anywhere
in Springfield over the question of Lincoln's domestic affairs.
It is possible to prove on the testimony of unimpeached witnesses
that Lincoln loved his wife passionately, and that he
did not love her at all; that he married Mary Todd because
he loved her and had already answered in his own heart all his
previous questions and misgivings, and that he married her
because she and her relatives practically compelled him to do
so, and that he went to the marriage altar muttering that he
was going to hell; that Mary Todd not only admired Abraham
Lincoln, but loved him with a beautiful and wifely devotion,
and that she hated him and never ceased to wreak revenge upon
him for having once deserted her upon the eve of their announced
marriage; that Mary Todd wore a white silk dress on
the night of her wedding, and that she never owned a white
silk dress until she had become a resident of the White House;
that the wedding was a gay affair, with a great dinner, and
was followed by a reception for which several hundred printed
invitations were issued, and that the wedding was hastily performed
on a Sunday evening, Mr. Dresser, the minister, cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ting
short his evening service and dropping in on the way
home to solemnize a quickly extemporized marriage contract.
It would seem fairly easy to discover from a calendar of the
year 1842 at least what day in the week was chosen for the
wedding, but few if any of the disputants, or even of the biographers,
appear to have taken this pains. If the present writer
should ever have occasion to write about Abraham Lincoln's
married life, he would not proceed very far without consulting
a calendar for that year; and he would hope to settle at least
one point in the controversy by telling the world that in 1842
the fourth day of November did not occur on Sunday or
Tuesday, but on Friday;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln both being
tinged with superstition, he might raise the question whether
the celebration of the wedding upon that date probably was
or was not long premeditated. But the present book does not
concern itself with these questions, and the matter is here
introduced merely to illustrate that no point in controversy
in a matter of this character can be definitely settled by the
unsupported testimony of a single honest witness relying upon
his memory after the lapse of many years.</p>

<p>Evidence such as we are to consider is of two kinds, known
in logic as <i>a priori</i> and <i>a posteriori</i>. The first kind is evidence
from antecedent probability; the second is evidence relating to
matter after the fact. An illustration will serve:</p>

<p>A man is found dead, with a wound in his forehead, and
there are no witnesses who can be produced in court who saw
the man die. The wound appears to have been produced by a
bullet, and, as no weapon is found beside the body, there is a
presumption that the man has been murdered. A neighbor is
accused of having committed the deed. The <i>a priori</i> evidence
is adduced in testimony that the defendant and the deceased
had long been on bad terms with each other on account of a
line fence between their adjacent properties; that the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>fendant
had threatened to kill the deceased and had recently
bought a revolver. The evidence <i>a posteriori</i> is found in the
fact that the defendant's revolver on examination shows one
empty chamber and that the ball in the deceased man's brain
is of the caliber suited to his weapon and of the same manufacture
as the unused cartridges in the weapon. To this may
be added other incriminating facts, as of measured footprints
near the scene of murder which correspond to the size of the
defendant's boots, and of possible blood stains upon his
clothing.</p>

<p>A very large volume of <i>a priori</i> evidence is sometimes set
aside by a single <i>a posteriori</i> fact; for instance, in the foregoing
supposititious case it may be entirely possible to prove that the
murder was committed by a tramp, and that the defendant was
ten miles away at the time the deed was done.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a large volume of <i>a posteriori</i> evidence
sometimes disappears in the face of a single <i>a priori</i> consideration.
A man is accused of having stolen a sheep. It is shown
in evidence that on the evening when the sheep was stolen he
walked through his neighbor's pasture and was seen to approach
the sheep; that he sold mutton on the day after the
loss of the sheep, and that a fresh sheepskin was found nailed
to his barn door. All this <i>a posteriori</i> evidence and much
more may be completely set aside in the minds of the jury by
the single fact that the man accused has lived for forty years
in the community and has borne a reputation incompatible
with the crime of sheep-stealing.</p>

<p>In the examination of testimony concerning alleged utterances
of Abraham Lincoln in matters of religious belief, we
must ask such questions as these:</p>

<p>Is the witness credible? Had he opportunity to know what
he professes to relate? Were other witnesses present, and if
so, do they agree in their recollection of the words spoken?
Was the interview published at a time when it could have been
denied by those who had knowledge of the incident? Had the
witness time to enlarge the incident by frequent telling and
by such exaggeration and enlargement of detail as is likely to
occur with the lapse of years? Had the witness a probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
motive for exaggeration; does he appear to tell what he would
presumably have liked Mr. Lincoln to say, and does it sound
more like the narrator's own style than it does like Mr.
Lincoln? Do the language and the sentiments expressed accord
with the published addresses, letters, and authentic documents
of Abraham Lincoln, and are the views expressed in
accord with the views which he is known to have held? On
the other hand, is it possible that in the freedom of personal
conversation Mr. Lincoln may have said some things which
he would not have been likely to say in formal discourse or
to write in official documents?</p>

<p>It is not necessary that we formally ask these and only
these questions; but these are the kinds of sieve through which
oral testimony must be passed if we are to learn the truth.</p>

<p>Particular care needs to be exercised in the application of
these tests, and especially in the employment of all <i>a priori</i>
methods. The author of this volume is a Christian minister,
and would be heartily glad to find in Mr. Lincoln's authentic
utterances indubitable evidence that Mr. Lincoln was essentially
a Christian; there is need that he take especial care not to
apply these discriminating tests in such fashion as to sustain
his own prejudices. Nor must he magnify his caution until it
becomes an inverted prejudice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <i>a priori</i> method must on no account
be ruled out. Mr. Lincoln left a great quantity of
authentic material. His speeches, letters, and state papers fill
twelve volumes, and even these do not contain all of his signed
material. We are compelled to judge alleged utterances of his
somewhat in the light of our certain knowledge of what he
wrote and said. Let us illustrate the application of this
principle:</p>

<p>If an aged man living in central Illinois were now to arise
and say: "I knew Abraham Lincoln, and he said to me one
day in private conversation, 'There is no God,'" we should be
justified in discrediting that man's testimony, even though he
bore a good reputation for veracity. The antecedent improbability
of such a declaration on the part of Mr. Lincoln is
too great for us to accept it on the basis of one man's recol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>lection
of a private and unwitnessed conversation fifty years
after Mr. Lincoln's death.</p>

<p>We should be equally justified in rejecting the testimony
at this late date of one of Mr. Lincoln's old-time neighbors
who would say that Mr. Lincoln told him that he believed the
whole of the Athanasian Creed.</p>

<p>Especial care is necessary in dealing with the alleged utterances
of deceased persons in matters of religion. The author
of this book has conducted a thousand funerals, and has been
told every conceivable kind of story concerning some of the
persons deceased. To the credit of our frail humanity be it
recorded that nine-tenths of this testimony was favorable.
There are few finer traits in human nature than those which
prompt us to speak only good of the dead. The eagerness
of those who have known not only the virtues but the faults of
living men to pass lightly over the faults and emphasize the
virtues of these same men when they are dead is not only a
manifestation of the finest sort of love of fair play in refusing
to accuse those who cannot make answer, but is also an exhibition
of one of the noblest impulses of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Even the tendency of ministers to lie like gentlemen on
funeral occasions is not to be too unsparingly condemned. It
springs from a belief that the better part of a man's life is
the truer part of him, and that a man has a right to be judged
by the best that is in him not only of achievement but even of
defeated aspiration.</p>

<p>William Allen White is fond of relating a story concerning
a funeral in Kansas. The minister was in the midst of his
eulogy when a man who had come in late and had not heard
the beginning of the discourse tiptoed down the aisle, took a
long look into the coffin, and returned to his seat. The minister,
somewhat disconcerted by this proceeding, addressed
him, saying, "The opportunity to view the remains will be
given later." "I know that," replied the man, "but I had
begun to suspect that I had gotten into the wrong funeral."</p>

<p>One who has had much experience with funerals and with
attempts to make dead men appear better than the same men
living actually were or appeared to be, knows that these efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
are not usually the result of deliberate falsehood. They grow
out of generous impulses and an easy tendency to exaggeration.
But some people do actually lie, and this fact also is
not wholly to be forgotten.</p>

<p>With these reminders of human frailty and human generosity
and of the uncertainty of all things human, we proceed
to examine in some detail the vast and contradictory mass of
evidence which after the death of Abraham Lincoln was
published concerning his faith or the lack of it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>What is in some respects the foremost example of platform
and pulpit oratory concerning Lincoln is the oration of Bishop
Charles Henry Fowler, deceased, of the Methodist Episcopal
Church. It illustrates at once the excellency and the defects
of works of this character. The oration had its beginning in
a eulogy delivered in Chicago on May 4, 1865, the day of Lincoln's
burial at Springfield. From time to time as years went
by, Bishop Fowler had occasion to deliver other addresses on
Lincoln, which, in 1904, he reshaped into something like the
final form of the oration. First delivered in Minneapolis, it
was repeated in many cities and before great audiences. It
became the Bishop's best known and most popular address.
It is the first and easily the greatest of the five that make up
the volume of his Patriotic Orations, the others being on Grant,
McKinley, Washington, and The Great Deeds of Great Men.
Of that large book it fills more than a hundred pages. It was
too long ever to be delivered at one time, but it was completely
written, and fully committed to memory, so that he chose at
each delivery what portions he would utter and what he would
omit. Even with the omissions he rarely spoke less than two
and one-half hours, and sometimes occupied three hours, his
audiences hearing with sustained interest to the close. Of it
his son says, that "through its delivery in various parts of the
country, and by the natural process of accretion and attraction,
new facts were added and others verified, until in 1906 it was
put in this final form."</p>

<p>Here is an address whose composition occupied a strong
and able man for thirty-one years. It thrills with admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
for its subject. It is alive with patriotism and religion. It
deserved, in many respects, the attention which it received.
Men have been known to say that having heard this address
they would never spoil the impression by listening to any other
address on Lincoln.</p>

<p>And yet it would not be safe to quote this lecture in any of
its substantial parts without further investigation of the
authority on which Bishop Fowler relied. He was a truthful
man, and a man of ability, and if he had been asked what
means he took to verify his statements, he would probably have
said that he admitted no statement to his lecture which he did
not find attested by some competent and truthful witness.
Doubtless so, and most of the lecture is true, and the impression
which it makes as a whole is substantially true, but that
is not enough. Doubtless Bishop Fowler read in some book or
magazine article by a truthful writer that on the day Lincoln
submitted the Emancipation proclamation to his Cabinet, he
first read in the presence of the Cabinet a chapter in the Bible.
It would not have required very much of investigation to have
convinced Bishop Fowler that what Lincoln really read was
not the Bible, but Artemus Ward. He did not intend to lie
about it. He picked up the account from some other speaker
who had heard or read that Lincoln read a chapter from some
book, and thought that the Bible was the proper book to read
on an occasion of that character. Neither the speaker nor
Bishop Fowler intended to be untruthful, but neither of them
had any training in or inclination toward historical investigation.
It would be easy to guess that a thousand Methodist
preachers and some others have retold the story on the authority
of Bishop Fowler. And that is far from being the only
inaccuracy in the lecture. Indeed, it shows throughout how
much it grew "by the natural process of accretion and attraction"
and how little by the verification of the facts.</p>

<p>This lecture is cited because it is in many respects the very
best of its type, as it is probably also the most noted, and
one that was delivered to more people than any other on
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>It does not suffice to rely upon any second authorities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
investigations of this character, nor to accept the statements of
even truthful witnesses without some sifting of the evidence.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we come to what is the most crucial
and difficult of all the incidents bearing upon our inquiry&mdash;the
incident reported to Dr. Holland by President Bateman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE BATEMAN INCIDENT</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Newton Bateman</span> was for many years Superintendent
of Public Instruction for the State of Illinois, being chosen to
that position in 1858 and holding the place with one brief
intermission for fourteen years. He was then elected President
of Knox College and served with distinction in that
capacity for seventeen years. He knew Lincoln well. He
was small in stature, and Lincoln was very tall. Lincoln used
to introduce Bateman to friends, saying, "This is my little
friend, the big schoolmaster of Illinois." He was, perhaps, the
last man to shake hands with Abraham Lincoln as Lincoln was
leaving Springfield, and he was one of the pallbearers at
Lincoln's funeral. The version of Lincoln's Farewell Address
which was published in the <i>Illinois State Journal</i> was printed
on the day following Lincoln's departure and was reproduced
from Dr. Bateman's memory of it. Although it varies from
the official report it appears to have been a very nearly accurate
report of what Lincoln actually said as judged by
Lincoln's own reproduction of the address.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the difficulties which
Dr. J. G. Holland met in Springfield when he journeyed
thither in quest of material on the <i>Life of Lincoln</i>. To his
great satisfaction he was able to obtain from Mr. Bateman an
incident which has become the corner-stone of a thousand
Lincoln eulogies. It is here reproduced entire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Newton Bateman,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Superintendent of Public Instruction
for the State of Illinois, occupied a room adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and opening into the Executive Chamber. Frequently this
door was open during Mr. Lincoln's receptions; and throughout
the seven months or more of his occupation Mr. Bateman
saw him nearly every day. Often when Mr. Lincoln was tired
he closed his door against all intrusion, and called Mr. Bateman
into his room for a quiet talk. On one of these occasions Mr.
Lincoln took up a book containing a careful canvass of the
city of Springfield in which he lived, showing the candidate
for whom each citizen had declared it his intention to vote in
the approaching election. Mr. Lincoln's friends had, doubtless
at his own request, placed the result of the canvass in his
hands. This was toward the close of October, and only a few
days before the election. Calling Mr. Bateman to a seat at his
side, having previously locked all doors, he said: 'Let us look
over this book. I wish particularly to see how the ministers of
Springfield are going to vote.' The leaves were turned, one by
one, and as the names were examined Mr. Lincoln frequently
asked if this one and that were not a minister, or an elder,
or a member of such or such a church, and sadly expressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
surprise on receiving an affirmative answer. In that manner
they went through the book, and then he closed it and sat
silently and for some minutes regarding a memorandum in
pencil which lay before him. At length he turned to Mr.
Bateman with a face full of sadness, and said: 'Here are
twenty-three, ministers, of different denominations, and all of
them are against me but three; and here are a great many
prominent members of the churches, a very large majority of
whom are against me. Mr. Bateman, I am not a Christian&mdash;God
knows I would be one&mdash;but I have carefully read the
Bible, and I do not so understand this book'; and he drew
from his bosom a pocket New Testament. 'These men well
know,' he continued, 'that I am for freedom in the territories,
freedom everywhere as far as the Constitution and laws will
permit, and that my opponents are for slavery. They know
this, and yet, with this book in their hands, in the light of
which human bondage cannot live a moment, they are going to
vote against me. I do not understand it at all.'</p>

<p>"Here Mr. Lincoln paused&mdash;paused for long minutes, his
features surcharged with emotion. Then he rose and walked
up and down the room in the effort to retain or regain his
self-possession. Stopping at last, he said, with a trembling
voice and his cheeks wet with tears: 'I know there is a God,
and that He hates injustice and slavery. I see the storm coming,
and I know that His hand is in it. If He has a place
and work for me&mdash;and I think He has&mdash;I believe I am ready.
I am nothing, but truth is everything. I know I am right
because I know that liberty is right, for Christ teaches it,
and Christ is God. I have told them that a house divided
against itself cannot stand, and Christ and reason say the
same; and they will find it so. Douglas don't care whether
slavery is voted up or voted down, but God cares, and humanity
cares, and I care; and with God's help I shall not fail. I
may not see the end; but it will come, and I shall be vindicated;
and these men will find that they have not read their Bibles
aright.'</p>

<p>"Much of this was uttered as if he were speaking to himself,
and with a sad and earnest solemnity of manner impossible
to be described. After a pause, he resumed: 'Doesn't
it appear strange that men can ignore the moral aspects of
this contest? A revelation could not make it plainer to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
that slavery or the government must be destroyed. The
future would be something awful, as I look at it, but for this
rock on which I stand [alluding to the Testament which he
still held in his hand] especially with the knowledge of how
these ministers are going to vote. It seems as if God had
borne with this thing [slavery] until the very teachers of
religion have come to defend it from the Bible, and to claim
for it a divine character and sanction; and now the cup of
iniquity is full, and the vials of wrath will be poured out.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holland</span>:
<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, pp. 236-38.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. J. G. Holland was an author of ability and character.
His <i>Life of Lincoln</i> was up to the time of its publication
far and away the best that had appeared. Even Herndon
and Lamon are compelled to speak of it with respect. Lamon
says: "Out of the mass of work which appeared, of one only&mdash;Dr.
Holland's&mdash;is it possible to speak with any degree of
respect." That this also represented substantially the opinion
of Herndon is clearly in evidence. With two such names as
Newton Bateman and J. G. Holland supporting it, an incident
of this character was certain to carry great weight. It can
be found more or less abridged and in some cases garbled and
enlarged in any one of a hundred books and of a thousand
or probably ten thousand Lincoln's Day addresses. This report
was the direct occasion for the assembling of a considerable
mass of opposing evidence which we shall find in succeeding
chapters. It was attacked publicly and directly by Ward Hill
Lamon in his <i>Life of Lincoln</i> in 1872. The following is Mr.
Lamon's reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Newton Bateman is reported to have said that a few
days before the Presidential election in 1860, Mr. Lincoln
came into his office, closed the door against intrusion, and proposed
to examine a book which had been furnished him, at his
own request, 'Containing a careful canvass of the city of
Springfield, showing the candidate for whom each citizen had
declared his intention to vote at the approaching election.
He ascertained that only three ministers of the gospel, out
of twenty-three, would vote for him, and that, of the prominent
church-members, a very large majority were against him.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Mr. Bateman does not say so directly, but the inference is plain
that Mr. Lincoln had not previously known what were the
sentiments of the Christian people who lived with him in
Springfield: he had never before taken the trouble to inquire
whether they were for him or against him. At all events, when
he made the discovery out of the book, he wept, and declared
that he 'did not understand it at all.' He drew from his
bosom a pocket New Testament, and, 'with a trembling voice
and his cheeks wet with tears,' quoted it against his political
opponents generally, and especially against Douglas. He
professed to believe that the opinions adopted by him and his
party were derived from the teachings of Christ; averred that
Christ was God; and, speaking of the Testament which he carried
in his bosom, called it 'this rock, on which I stand.'
When Mr. Bateman expressed surprise, and told him that his
friends generally were ignorant that he entertained such sentiments,
he gave this answer quickly: 'I know they are: I am
obliged to appear different to them.' Mr. Bateman is a respectable
citizen, whose general reputation for truth and
veracity is not to be impeached; but his story, as reported in
Holland's Life, is so inconsistent with Mr. Lincoln's whole
character, that it must be rejected as altogether incredible.
From the time of the Democratic split in the Baltimore Convention,
Mr. Lincoln, as well as every other politician of the
smallest sagacity, knew that his success was as certain as any
future could be. At the end of October, most of the States
had clearly voted in a way which left no lingering doubts of
the final result in November. If there ever was a time in his
life when ambition charmed his whole heart,&mdash;if it could ever
be said of him that 'hope elevated and joy brightened his
crest,' it was on the eve of that election which he saw was to
lift him at last to the high place for which he had sighed and
struggled so long. It was not then that he would mourn and
weep because he was in danger of not getting the votes of the
ministers and members of the churches he had known during
many years for his steadfast opponents: he did not need them,
and had not expected them. Those who understood him best
are very sure that he never, under any circumstances, could
have fallen into such weakness&mdash;not even when his fortunes
were at the lowest point of depression&mdash;as to play the part
of a hypocrite for their support. Neither is it possible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
he was at any loss about the reasons which religious men had
for refusing him their support; and, if he had said that he
could not understand it at all, he must have spoken falsely.
But the worst part of the tale is Mr. Lincoln's acknowledgment
that his 'friends generally were deceived concerning his
religious sentiments, and that he was obliged to appear different
to them.'</p>

<p>"According to this version, which has had considerable
currency, he carried a New Testament in his bosom, carefully
hidden from his intimate associates: he believed that Christ
was God; yet his friends understood him to deny the verity
of the gospel: he based his political doctrines on the teachings
of the Bible; yet before all men, except Mr. Bateman, he
habitually acted the part of an unbeliever and reprobate, because
he was 'obliged to appear different to them.' How
obliged? What compulsion required him to deny that Christ
was God if he really believed Him to be divine? Or did he put
his political necessities above the obligations of truth, and
oppose Christianity against his convictions, that he might win
the favor of its enemies? It may be that his mere silence was
sometimes misunderstood; but he never made an express
avowal of any religious opinion which he did not entertain.
He did not 'appear different' at one time from what he was
at another, and certainly he never put on infidelity as a mere
mask to conceal his Christian character from the world. There
is no dealing with Mr. Bateman, except by a flat contradiction.
Perhaps his memory was treacherous, or his imagination led
him astray, or, peradventure, he thought a fraud no harm if
it gratified the strong desire of the public for proofs of Mr.
Lincoln's orthodoxy. It is nothing to the purpose that Mr.
Lincoln said once or twice that he thought this or that portion
of the Scripture was the product of divine inspiration; for he
was one of the class who hold that all truth is inspired, and
that every human being with a mind and a conscience is a
prophet. He would have agreed much more readily with one
who taught that Newton's discoveries, or Bacon's philosophy,
or one of his own speeches, were the works of men divinely
inspired above their fellows. But he never told anyone that
he accepted Jesus Christ, or performed a single one of the acts
which necessarily follow upon such a conviction. At Springfield
and at Washington he was beset on the one hand by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
political priests, and on the other by honest and prayerful
Christians. He despised the former, respected the latter, and
had use for both. He said with characteristic irreverence, that
he would not undertake 'to run the churches by military
authority'; but he was, nevertheless, alive to the importance
of letting the churches 'run themselves in the interest of his
party.' Indefinite expressions about 'Divine Providence,' the
'justice of God,' 'the favor of the Most High,' were easy,
and not inconsistent with his religious notion. In this, accordingly,
he indulged freely; but never in all that time did
he let fall from his lips or his pen an expression which remotely
implied the slightest faith in Jesus as the Son of God and the
Saviour of men."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, pp. 499-502.</p></blockquote>

<p>Confronted by an irreconcilable contradiction like this, the
easiest way is to cut the knot, and this may be done by any one
of several methods. We may say that, while Lamon and
Herndon were truthful men, their reputation for veracity,
good as it was, is less than that of Bateman and Holland, and
we prefer to believe the latter pair. Or, we may say that, while
Bateman knew Lincoln well, both Herndon and Lamon knew
him much better, and were better able to judge what Lincoln
would have said. Or, we may say that Bateman was present
when Lincoln spoke, and Holland was present when Bateman
related the interview, and neither Herndon nor Lamon was
present on either occasion, and we will believe the one credible
witness who was actually there, and whose positive testimony
outweighs any possible volume of negative testimony on the
part of men who were not present, and who only imagine what
Mr. Lincoln would probably have said. Or, we may say that
in the light of the inherent improbability of such an utterance
on the part of Mr. Lincoln, as determined by a comparison of
this alleged utterance with his authentic statements, we cannot
accept it, even though the two men who vouch, the one for
its utterance and the other for its transmission, are men of
exceptional veracity. Or, we may say that in such a conflict of
direct evidence and inherent improbability, and the mutual opposition
of honest men who were in a position to know some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>thing
about the religious views of Mr. Lincoln, it is impossible
for us to decide.</p>

<p>We will not seek by any of these convenient methods to
cut the knot, but endeavor to untie it. We are fortunate in
having some collateral evidence after the fact.</p>

<p>Herndon had awaited the publication of Holland's book
with great eagerness, and he was pleased with it as a whole.
But the Bateman incident roused his wrath. To him it made
Lincoln a hypocrite, dissembling a Christian faith, which he
had no good reason to conceal, beneath a pretense of infidelity,
which was not, as Herndon believed, a profession that would
have helped him.</p>

<p>Herndon promptly walked over to the State House and
interviewed Mr. Bateman. "I instantly sought Mr. Bateman,"
he said, "and found him in his office. I spoke to him
politely and kindly, and he spoke to me in the same manner.
I said substantially to him that Mr. Holland, in order to make
Mr. Lincoln a technical Christian, had made him a hypocrite."</p>

<p>What Bateman said to Herndon he was forbidden to publish,
but the inference is ineluctable that he repudiated, in
part, the interview with Holland, but did it on condition that
Herndon should not publish the statement in a way that would
raise the issue of veracity between himself and Holland.</p>

<p>This was in the autumn of 1865. In the spring of 1866,
Herndon again called upon Bateman, but got no farther.</p>

<p>As the controversy waxed furious, Herndon made further
and insistent efforts to obtain from Bateman a statement which
could be made to the public. Herndon preserved notes of the
interviews, which he dated, December 3, 12, and 28, 1866.
Bateman still refused to emerge from his silence. One can
imagine Herndon in his yellow trousers twice rolled up at
the bottom, hitching his chair a little closer to the little superintendent,
and with long, skinny forefinger outstretched, probing
with insistent cross-examination into the innermost recesses
of the <i>ipsissima versa</i> of the interview with Lincoln and the
subsequent one with Holland. Whether he and Mr. Bateman
continued to address each other politely is not known, but
Herndon endeavored first to persuade and afterward to force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Bateman to do one of three things,&mdash;to avow over his own signature
the story as Holland told it; to repudiate the interview
and throw the responsibility upon Holland; or to permit
Herndon to publish what Bateman had told to him. Bateman
would do none of these three things. If he did the first,
Herndon would accuse him of falsehood; if he did the second,
Holland would accuse him of falsehood; and if he did the
third, he would become the central figure in a controversy
that already had become more than red-hot. He refused to
say anything, and announced to all comers that the publicity
was "extremely distasteful" to him.</p>

<p>Herndon went as far as he could toward making public
what Bateman told to him. He published the following statement,
designed to throw the greater part of the blame upon
Holland, but to force Bateman to relate to the public what
Bateman had said to him, and what he had written down and
held ready to produce:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I cannot now detail what Mr. Bateman said, as it was
a private conversation, and I am forbidden to make use of it
in public. If some good gentleman can only get the seal of
secrecy removed, I can show what was said and done. On
my word, the world may take it for granted that Holland is
wrong; that he does not state Mr. Lincoln's views correctly.
Mr. Bateman, if correctly represented in Holland's <i>Life of
Lincoln</i>, is the only man, the sole and only man, who dare say
that Mr. Lincoln believed in Jesus as the Christ of God, as
the Christian world represents. This is not a pleasant situation
for Mr. Bateman. I have notes and dates of our conversation;
and the world will sometime know who is truthful,
and who is otherwise. I doubt whether Bateman is correctly
represented by Holland."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 496.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Bateman was, indeed, in an uncomfortable position
and any one of the three ways out of it seemed likely to make
it still more uncomfortable. He continued to maintain a
profound silence. Years afterward when Arnold was preparing
his <i>Life of Lincoln</i> for the press and Arnold asked
him concerning the truth of the incident as recorded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Holland, he replied with extreme brevity that it was "substantially
correct." (Arnold: Life of Lincoln, p. 179).</p>

<p>The only portion of Bateman's admission to Herndon
which Bateman finally, and with great reluctance, consented to
have published, was one which covered the alleged utterance
"Christ is God." It was a letter written in 1867, and marked
"Confidential." In this letter Bateman said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He [Lincoln] was applying the principles of moral and
religious truth to the duties of the hour, the condition of the
country, and the conduct of public men&mdash;ministers of the
gospel. I had no thought of orthodoxy or heterodoxy, Unitarianism,
Trinitarianism, or any other ism, during the whole
conversation, and I don't suppose or believe he had."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a guarded letter, but it is sufficiently specific for
our purposes. If the conversation between Bateman and Lincoln
was of this character, with nothing to distinguish the view
of Lincoln as Unitarian or Trinitarian, Lincoln certainly did
not say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I know I am right because I know that liberty is right,
for Christ teaches it, and Christ is God."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is evident that Bateman, crowded by Herndon in repeated
cross-examination, came as near to repudiating those
parts of the interview to which Herndon objected as he could
do without raising publicly the issue of veracity between himself
and Holland. The attitude of Dr. Bateman in this matter
forbids us to believe that the story as it stands in Holland's
book can be true.</p>

<p>Bateman is not mentioned in the index of Nicolay and
Hay's <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, and it is practically certain that they
did not credit the incident.</p>

<p>What, under these circumstances, shall be our judgment
concerning this most hotly contested of all incidents concerning
the religious life of Abraham Lincoln?</p>

<p>The incident had a basis of fact. Neither Bateman nor
Holland would have created such a story out of whole cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
But Bateman was under very strong temptation to enlarge
upon the incident, and had had five years in which to magnify
it in his own mind. The then recent death of Mr. Lincoln
and the strong desire of Christian people for a clear statement
of his faith, made it easy to color the recollection and sketch
in details, which did not seem to be important departures from
the truth when related in verbal conversation, but which had
a different look when they appeared in cold type. Holland,
who was a writer of fiction as well as history, did not fail to
embellish the story as Bateman told it to him. He probably
did not write it down at the time, but recalled it afterward
from memory, and in his final report it underwent additional
coloring and the sketching in of detail.</p>

<p>Neither of these two men intentionally falsified, but between
the two the story was materially enlarged, and there
was an undistributed margin of error between the original
event as it occurred in 1860 and the very pretty story which
Holland printed in 1865. Neither Holland nor Bateman cared,
probably, to face too searching an inquiry as to how that
enlargement had come.</p>

<p>Dr. Bateman was a man of probity and upright character.
He never willfully misrepresented. But he had a rhetorical
mind; not only his style, but his mind, was rhetorical. He
embellished his narratives because it was in him to do so.
The two reports which he made of Lincoln's farewell address
in Springfield<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> showed, both of them, such embellishments,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and he was as unconscious that he in later years enlarged
upon his own first report as he was that his first report enlarged
upon the address itself. These enlargements were
slight, and did not destroy nor greatly alter the sense; but
his changes never tended to simplicity. He was a master of
good English style, but it was a grander, more rhetorical style
than that of Lincoln. Lincoln, after receiving his special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
notice of nomination, submitted his letter of acceptance to
Bateman, and at Bateman's suggestion changed a split infinitive.
Lincoln knew that Bateman was an authority on
good English, and respected his opinion and valued his friendship.
Whatever enlargements Bateman's memory made upon
his interview with Lincoln were made without intent to deceive;
and whatever Holland added was added without intent
to deceive. But the interview of 1860 and the story about it
in Holland's book five years later have between them a discrepancy
which must be distributed in a ratio which we are
not able positively to determine between two good and truthful
men, each of whom enlarged a little upon the material that was
given to him.</p>

<p>A final evidence that Bateman saw no way to remedy the
situation by telling the public exactly what occurred in his
interview with Lincoln in 1860, is found in the fact that while
he was President of Knox College he had occasion to prepare
and deliver there and elsewhere a carefully written lecture on
"Abraham Lincoln." Every generation of Knox College
students heard, at least once, that famous oration. That lecture
contains little else than Bateman's own personal reminiscences,
and is an interesting and valuable document. For our
present purpose it is chiefly valuable in this, that it contains
not one word about the interview which had forever associated
the name of Newton Bateman with that of Abraham Lincoln.
The fact that Bateman felt compelled to omit it altogether
from that oft-repeated lecture on Lincoln is a sufficient reason
why no one else should ever use it.</p>

<p>Precisely what did Bateman tell Herndon that he had told
to Holland, which led Herndon to tell the public that Holland
misrepresented Bateman? We do not know precisely. What
became of Herndon's carefully cherished notes of his five
interviews with Bateman is not known,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but we are not left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
wholly to conjecture. Though Herndon was forbidden to tell
what Bateman told to him, he came as near to it as he could
do without open violation of his pledge of secrecy. In his
own <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, published in 1889, he inserted a footnote
in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One of what Lincoln regarded as the remarkable features
of his canvass for President was the attitude of some
of his neighbors in Springfield. A poll of the voters had been
made in a little book and given to him. On running over
the names he found that the greater part of the clergy of the
city&mdash;in fact all but three&mdash;were against him. This depressed
him somewhat, and he called in Dr. Newton Bateman, who
as Superintendent of Public Instruction occupied the room adjoining
his own in the State House, and whom he habitually
addressed as 'Mr. Schoolmaster.' He commented bitterly on
the attitude of the preachers and many of their followers,
who, pretending to be believers in the Bible and God-fearing
Christians, yet by their votes demonstrated that they cared not
whether slavery was voted up or down. 'God cares and
humanity cares,' he reflected, 'and if they do not they surely
have not read their Bible aright.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Herndon</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
III, 466-67.</p></blockquote>

<p>To accept this as containing the essential part of the interview
between Lincoln and Bateman does not involve our preferring
the statement of Herndon to that of Bateman, for
we have no definite statement of Bateman. Bateman, under
close examination, told Herndon what he remembered that
Lincoln told him, and Herndon promised not to tell it without
Bateman's permission. Herndon did tell, however, that it
was very different from Holland's story, and he published this
in Lamon's book in 1872 and Bateman did not deny it. He
published the above quoted and additional note in his own book
in 1889, while Bateman was living, and Bateman did not
protest. We cannot, therefore, be far from the truth if we
accept the above and stop there.</p>

<p>Unless the notes of Herndon's five interviews with Bateman
shall be found and published, this is probably the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
we shall ever come to knowing what Bateman told Herndon
that Lincoln had said to him. If those notes shall be found,
they may amplify the conversation but cannot be expected
materially to modify it. This is all that it is safe to assume
of Lincoln's confession of faith to Bateman. Whoever adds
to it the glosses of the Holland biography does it at his own
risk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE LAMON BIOGRAPHY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ward Hill Lamon</span> was for many years a close friend of
Lincoln.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Their relations began in 1847 when Lamon settled
at Danville and continued until Lincoln's death. Both there
and at Bloomington, Lamon was Lincoln's local associate and
so-called partner. When Lincoln voted at the Presidential
election of 1860, the men who accompanied him to the polls
were William H. Herndon, Ward Hill Lamon, and Col.
Elmer Ellsworth. When Lincoln was elected and his political
friends had slated Lamon for a foreign mission, Lincoln appointed
him Marshal of the District of Columbia that he might
have him close at hand. He was a member of the party which
accompanied Lincoln to Washington, and when through apparent
danger of assassination the route was changed and
Lincoln slipped into Washington with a single companion, it
was Lamon whom he chose to accompany him. Lamon had
charge of the arrangements of Lincoln's trip to Gettysburg,
and accompanied Lincoln and was in charge when he visited
the battlefield of Antietam. His book of personal "Recollections,"
edited by his daughter and published in 1895, is full
of interest and contains much of permanent value. His <i>Life
of Abraham Lincoln</i>, published in 1872, is the most bitterly
denounced of all the biographies of Lincoln. It involved its
author and publisher in heavy financial loss, and the unsold
portion of the edition is alleged to have been bought up by
friends of Lincoln and quietly destroyed. Lamon intended
to have followed this volume, whose subject-matter ended with
Lincoln's arrival in Washington in 1861, with a second volume
covering Lincoln's life as President, but neither a second
volume nor a second edition of the first was ever issued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>How Lamon, being a friend of Lincoln, could ever have
written such a book has been the subject of much conjecture.
Herndon believed that during the latter part of his life in
Washington Lamon had become embittered against Lincoln.
Lamon's daughter in a magazine article on the subject professed
her father's abiding friendship for Lincoln, but maintained
that he was endeavoring to tell the true story of a great
life and to recover the real Lincoln from the realm of myth
(Dorothy Lamon Teillard: "Lincoln in Myth and in Fact,"
<i>World's Work</i>, February, 1911, pp. 14040-44).</p>

<p>The basis of Lamon's book is the Herndon manuscripts,
copies of which Herndon sold to Lamon for $2,000 in 1870.
That Herndon bitterly regretted the necessity of this sale,
there is clear evidence; but he had come to a condition of
great poverty; and there were other reasons why it seemed
unlikely that he himself would ever write a Life of Lincoln.
That Lamon himself wrote the book without assistance was
disputed from the beginning, and Herndon was accused of
being its real author. In letters to Horace White in 1890,
Herndon told the truth, as is now believed, concerning the
authorship.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You regret, as well as myself, that I sold my MSS. to
Lamon. The reason why I did so was that I was then, in
1870-72, a poor devil and had to sell to live. From 1853 to
1865 I spent all my time and money for the 'nigger,' or rather
for Liberty and the Union&mdash;lost my practice, went to farming,
and went under in the crash of 1871-73, and that, too, from
no speculations, vices, etc. Today I have to work for tomorrow's
bread, and yet I am a happy and contented man.
I own a little farm of sixty-five acres and raise fruits for a
living. Now you have the reasons for my acts.</p>

<p>"In reference to Lamon's book, I can truthfully say that
Chauncey F. Black,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> son of J. S. Black, wrote quite every
word of it.... I have for years been written to by various
persons to know why Lamon was so much prejudiced against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Lincoln. The bitterness, if any, was not in Lamon so much
as in Black, though I am convinced that Lamon was no solid,
firm friend of Lincoln, especially during Lincoln's administration,
or the latter part of it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Newton</span>: <i>Lincoln and
Herndon</i>, pp. 307-8.</p></blockquote>

<p>Herndon stoutly denied having written a single line of
Lamon's book, but he furnished the greater part of the material
in the form of documents, and gave further aid by
letters and suggestions. Thirteen years after it was published
he wrote to Lamon, who was still hoping to issue a new
biography which would include the volume already issued
and a second volume, and said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I desire to see your new Life win. Your first Life is
nearly suppressed&mdash;is suppressed or will be by rings&mdash;bears,
and like. Lamon's first Life of Lincoln is the truest Life
that was ever written of a man, as I think. I do not agree
to all it says, and yet it is the most truthful Life of Lincoln
written, or to be written probably, except your second Life.
. . . Why, Lamon, if you and I had not told the exact
truth about Lincoln, he would have been a myth in a hundred
years after 1865. We knew him&mdash;loved him&mdash;had ideas
and had the courage of our convictions. We told the world
what Lincoln was and were terribly abused for it."&mdash;(<i>World's
Work</i>, February, 1911, p. 14044).</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the chief things which Lamon set out to do was
to refute Holland's estimate of Lincoln's faith, particularly
as it appeared in Holland's account of the Bateman story.
Lamon held that any impression which people got that Lincoln
possessed substantial Christian faith, was due to the fact that
Lincoln was a wily politician, who saw the power and appreciated
the prejudices of the churches and was determined not
to suffer from their hostility. He not only grew more cautious
as he grew older, but actually dissembled. His religious references
were made as vague and general as possible, and he
permitted himself to be misunderstood and misrepresented
by ministers and others because of "his morbid ambition,
coupled with a mortal fear that his popularity would suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
by an open avowal of his deistic convictions" (Lamon, <i>Life
of Lincoln</i>, p. 498).</p>

<p>His estimate of Lincoln is that "On the whole, he was an
honest, although a shrewd, and by no means unselfish politician."
He attributes Lincoln's melancholy definitely to his
utter lack of faith.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is very probable that much of Mr. Lincoln's unhappiness,
the melancholy that 'dripped from him as he walked,'
was due to his want of religious faith. When the black fit
was on him, he suffered as much mental misery as Bunyan
or Cowper in the deepest anguish of their conflicts with the
Evil One. But the unfortunate conviction fastened upon him
by his early associations, that there was no truth in the Bible,
made all consolation impossible, and penitence useless. To a
man of his temperament, predisposed as it was to depression
of spirit, there could be no chance of happiness if doomed
to live without hope and without God in the world. He might
force himself to be merry with his chosen comrades; he might
'banish sadness' in mirthful conversation, or find relief in
a jest; gratified ambition might elevate his feelings, and give
him ease for a time: but solid comfort and permanent peace
could come to him only 'through a correspondence fixed
with heaven.' The fatal misfortune of his life, looking at
it only as it affected him in this world, was the influence at
New Salem and at Springfield which enlisted him on the side
of unbelief. He paid the bitter penalty in a life of misery."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>,
<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 504.</p></blockquote>

<p>In support of this thesis, Lamon, aided and abetted by
Herndon, sought for testimonials from those who had known
Lincoln, endeavoring to prove that he had no religious faith.
Herndon himself wrote a letter which we shall quote later
because of its bearing upon a particular point which we have
yet to discuss, and gave the names of Judge Logan, John T.
Stuart, Joshua F. Speed, and James H. Matheny as those
who would confirm his declaration that Lincoln was an infidel.
Herndon's own definition of the term infidel is susceptible of
such varying definitions in his different letters and published
articles that it is not always easy to tell just what he meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
by it, but in some of these he was specific and told, from his
own alleged knowledge or his memory of the testimony of
others, what Lincoln believed and denied. Judge Logan
appears not to have contributed to the discussion, but from
several of the others and from some other men whose letters
Herndon already had, Lamon made up a considerable volume
of testimony concerning the unbelief of Lincoln. Some of
these we quote, reserving others for later consideration.</p>

<p>Hon. John T. Stuart was alleged to have said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I knew Mr. Lincoln when he first came here, and for
years afterwards. He was an avowed and open infidel, sometimes
bordered on atheism. I have often and often heard
Lincoln and one W. D. Herndon, who was a free-thinker,
talk over this subject. Lincoln went further against Christian
beliefs and doctrines and principles than any man I ever heard:
he shocked me. I don't remember the exact line of his argument:
suppose it was against the inherent defects, so called,
of the Bible, and on grounds of reason. Lincoln always
denied that Jesus was the Christ of God,&mdash;denied that Jesus
was the Son of God, as understood and maintained by the
Christian Church. The Rev. Dr. Smith, who wrote a letter,
tried to convert Lincoln from infidelity so late as 1858, and
couldn't do it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 488.</p></blockquote>

<p>It later developed that these quotations which appeared
in Lamon's book in the form of letters to Herndon were in
some instances, if not in all, Herndon's own reports of conversations
with these friends of Lincoln, and not, in any
case, signed letters. Several of the putative authors repudiated
the statements attributed to them.</p>

<p>Dr. C. H. Ray was quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not know how I can aid you. You [Herndon]
knew Mr. Lincoln far better than I did, though I knew him
well; and you have served up his leading characteristics in a
way that I should despair of doing, if I should try. I have
only one thing to ask: that you do not give Calvinistic theology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
a chance to claim him as one of its saints and martyrs. He
went to the Old-School Church; but, in spite of that outward
assent to the horrible dogmas of the sect, I have reason from
himself to know that his 'vital purity,' if that means belief
in the impossible, was of a negative sort."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>, <i>Life of
Lincoln</i>, pp. 489-90.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hon. David Davis was quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not know anything about Lincoln's religion, and do
not think anybody knew. The idea that Lincoln talked to a
stranger about his religion or religious views, or made such
speeches, remarks, etc., about it as are published, is to me
absurd. I knew the man so well: he was the most reticent,
secretive man I ever saw, or expect to see. He had no faith,
in the Christian sense of the term,&mdash;had faith in laws, principles,
causes, and effects&mdash;philosophically: you [Herndon]
know more about his religion than any man. You ought to
know it, of course."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 489.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lamon also printed a letter from James H. Matheny, who
had been Lincoln's "best man" at his wedding, and a long-time
and intimate friend. It would be included in this chapter,
as it is to be referred to in the next, but it is reserved for a
more important use in the chapter on "Lincoln's Burnt Book."</p>

<p>Lamon's <i>Life of Lincoln</i> lashed into greater fury the
tempest that already raged concerning Lincoln's religious
faith. Nor was this the only criticism upon it. It was the
first of the Lives of Lincoln to which the later term of "muckraking"
might have been applied, and its spirit of hostility
is best accounted for by the fact that its real author was not
Lamon but Black, who not only entertained all the local
prejudice which one element in Springfield had against Lincoln,
but represented also a bitter political hostility, Black's
father having been a member of Buchanan's Cabinet. Indeed
there is alleged to have been a three-cornered and acrimonious
dispute among the publishers, Lamon, and Black concerning
an omitted chapter on Buchanan's administration which had
something to do with one aspect of the book's financial failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Black and Lamon and the publishers all lost money and the
book was a financial disaster.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its tone of astonishing bitterness against
Lincoln, its shocking bad taste and its perverted viewpoint,
Lamon's biography is a valuable source of information. Concerning
it John Hay wrote to Lamon, "Nothing heretofore
printed can compare with it in interest, and from the nature
of the case all subsequent writers will have to come to you
for a large class of facts."</p>

<p>In 1895 Lamon's daughter Dorothy, subsequently Mrs.
Teillard, published a book of "Recollections" of Lincoln by
her father, with no objectionable matter, and with a considerable
number of valuable incidents. But this later book,
while avoiding the occasions of criticism which the first book
evoked, added little to the character study which the first
volume, with all its manifold defects, had contained.</p>

<p>Lamon was a very different man from Lincoln&mdash;so different
that men who knew them both wondered at Lincoln's
fondness for him. And he knew Lincoln intimately. But he
was not capable of interpreting the best that was in Lincoln.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE REED LECTURE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the first results of the Lamon biography was a lecture
prepared by Rev. James A. Reed, pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Springfield. This lecture<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was delivered
several times, and in 1873 was published in <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>,
which at that time was edited by J. G. Holland. Holland
had been horrified by the Lamon biography, and had reviewed
it with such disfavor that Herndon attributes the failure of
the book in no small part to Holland's pronounced opposition.
This lecture, published in so widely read a magazine, produced
a profound impression. A doubt which Lamon had raised and
which Herndon later had the bad taste to emphasize concerning
Lincoln's paternity turned to good advantage; and Reed produced
from several of the men whom Lamon had quoted,
counter-statements declaring that they had been misquoted.
Of these was James H. Matheny, whose statement to Herndon
we are to consider in connection with the story of Lincoln's
burnt book and who wrote to Dr. Reed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The language attributed to me in Lamon's book is not
from my pen. I did not write it, and it does not express my
sentiment of Mr. Lincoln's entire life and character. It is a
mere collection of sayings gathered from private conversations
that were only true of Mr. Lincoln's earlier life. I
would not have allowed such an article to be printed over my
signature as covering my opinion of Mr. Lincoln's life and
religious sentiments. While I do believe Mr. Lincoln to have
been an infidel in his former life, when his mind was as yet
unformed, and his associations principally with rough and
skeptical men, yet I believe he was a very different man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
later life; and that after associating with a different class of
men, and investigating the subject, he was a firm believer in
the Christian religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Major John T. Stuart also repudiated the statement
attributed to him, and not only so but gave detailed and
positive statements which directly contradicted the more important
part of what Lamon had attributed to him.</p>

<p>Dr. Reed went further and set forth with a considerable
degree of precision the grounds for the statement that Lincoln's
views had undergone marked change during his life in
Springfield, particularly under the influence of Dr. Reed's
predecessor, the Rev. James Smith.</p>

<p>Dr. Reed's lecture became the subject of acrimonious
attack. His article was flouted, belittled, and railed at. But
its essential affirmations have not been disproved. We shall
devote a chapter to a consideration of the relations of Dr.
Smith to Mr. Lincoln and shall find that Dr. Reed's claims
were not extravagant.</p>

<p>Other controversialists took up the pen about this time
in confutation of Lamon. One of the most interesting and
valuable of the contributions which then appeared was an
article by B. F. Irwin, of Pleasant Plains, Illinois, published
in the <i>Illinois State Journal</i>, for May 16, 1874.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He produced
a considerable number of letters from men who had known
Mr. Lincoln prior to his residence in Springfield and whose
knowledge of his religious beliefs at that time was intimate
and accurate. Of these by far the most important was from
Lincoln's old teacher, Mentor Graham, which we shall quote
at length in the chapter on Lincoln's "Burnt Book."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Among these were letters from men who professed to
have heard Lincoln charged with infidelity and had heard
him deny it. The most important of these letters, however,
aside from that of Mentor Graham, have value for us in the
light they shed upon what really constituted Lincoln's alleged
infidelity at this early period. That he had doubts and mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>givings
upon various subjects was not denied, but his hostility
to the orthodox belief expressed itself chiefly in a vigorous
denial of the endlessness of future punishment. This dogma
Lincoln denied upon two grounds, as these letters affirm.
First, the justice and mercy of God; and secondly, the fact
that according to the Biblical scheme of redemption, whatever
right the human race had possessed to immortality and lost
through sin, had been restored in Christ. Lincoln was, according
to the testimony of a number of these men who had known
him, not an infidel, nor even a deist, but essentially a Universalist.</p>

<p>Irwin had interviewed Colonel James H. Matheny and
quoted Matheny as denying that he had ever heard Lincoln
admit that he was an infidel and did not himself believe it.
Irwin himself had known Lincoln personally for many years
and had known large numbers of men who were intimately
acquainted with him and he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have never yet heard one single man express the belief
that Lincoln was an infidel. Mr. Herndon, it is true, did
have opportunities over others in knowing Mr. Lincoln's
religious opinions, but other men had some opportunities, as
well as Mr. Herndon, and to them I shall have to appeal, for
I do not claim to personally know anything about Mr. Lincoln's
religious faith. Though personally acquainted with Mr. Lincoln
for twenty-eight years and often in his office, I never
heard him say a word on the subject of his religious belief."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noted that while the statements concerning
Mr. Lincoln's alleged infidelity have been published over the
name of Lamon, Herndon was held responsible for them in
these controversies. The impetuous Herndon possessed none
of the reticence of Bateman; and while denying that he wrote
Lamon's book, rushed in as Lamon's champion and covered
himself with wounds if not with glory.</p>

<p>Irwin's article proceeds to quote these old neighbors and
friends of Lincoln, whose testimony, added to those adduced
by Dr. Reed, was of very great weight. I have copied these<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
from the files of the <i>Illinois State Journal</i> in the Library of
the Illinois State Historical Society in Springfield and here
produce three of them, reserving others for later comment.</p>

<p>One of the letters quoted in full by Irwin was from
Thomas Mostiller, of Pleasant Plains, Menard County, Illinois.
He professed to have heard Lincoln when he was a candidate
for Congress in 1847 or 1848, when he was charged with
being an infidel and explicitly denied it. Said he:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was present and heard Josiah Grady ask Lincoln a
question or two regarding a charge made against Lincoln
of being an infidel, and Lincoln unqualifiedly denied the charge
of infidelity, and said, in addition, his parents were Baptists,
and brought him up in the belief of the Christian religion;
and he believed it as much as anyone, but was sorry to say he
had or made no pretensions to religion himself. I can't give
his exact words, but would make oath anywhere that he positively
denied the charge made against him of infidelity. That
was the first time I ever heard the charge of infidelity against
Lincoln. Grady did not say that he would not vote for
Lincoln if he was an infidel, but my understanding from
Grady was that he would not vote for Lincoln if he was an
infidel; and Grady did, as I suppose, vote for him. I understood
him that he should."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another statement was by Jonathan Harnett. It was not
made in a letter, like the others, but was verbally stated to
Mr. Irwin, who wrote it from Harnett's dictation, and was
then read to him and endorsed by him. Mr. Harnett related
an incident which he declared himself to have witnessed in
Lincoln's office in 1858, when an argument was held on the
truth of the Christian religion, a number of men participating.
He affirmed that Mr. Lincoln ended the discussion by a cogent
argument based on the restitution of all things in Christ, and
the ultimate salvation of all men.</p>

<p>This line of argument, attested by a number who heard
Mr. Lincoln in these discussions, will be readily understood
by those who have heard, as he had heard from his infancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the typical argument of the backwoods Baptist preacher, and
who appreciates Mr. Lincoln's theory of the irrevocability of
the Divine will, and the relation of the atonement to the restitution
of all things. The essential difference between Lincoln's
point of view and that of these preachers was that the
preachers saw in the work of Christ the basis of personal
forgiveness of sin; and Lincoln saw in it rather a manifestation
of the irrevocable law of God for the ultimate salvation
of the race.</p>

<p>Another of the letters included in the Irwin article was
one from Isaac Cogdal, who related a conversation in Lincoln's
office in Herndon's presence, in which Lincoln expressed himself
somewhat as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He did not nor could not believe in the endless punishment
of any one of the human race. He understood punishment
for sin to be a Bible doctrine; that punishment was
parental in its object, aim and design, and intended for the
good of the offender; hence it must cease when justice was
satisfied. He added that all that was lost by the transgression
of Adam was made good by the atonement; all that was lost
by the fall was made good by the sacrifice; and he added this
remark, that punishment being a 'provision of the gospel
system, he was not sure but the world would be better off if a
little more punishment was preached by our ministers, and not
so much of pardon of sin.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>I need only add, that to me these letters carry the conviction
of reality. Lincoln had been rooted and grounded in
the kind of dogma that began with Adam and related to his
fall in vital sort the atonement of Christ. That Lincoln had
some doubts concerning the person of Christ is not in point.
He believed in God, and he knew the fact of sin, and he was
dyed in the wool in arguments concerning the fall of the
race in Adam and its redemption in Christ. But he did not
dwell as did the preachers on individual forgiveness, which
he sometimes doubted, but sought to evolve a legal and moral
scheme with a final restoration. I regard these testimonies
as essentially true.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE HERNDON LECTURES, LETTERS, AND<br />
BIOGRAPHY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of William H. Herndon finds frequent mention in
these pages, as it must in any study of Abraham Lincoln.
With all his faults as a biographer, his astigmatism, his anti-religious
prejudice, his intolerance, his bad taste, he is an
invaluable source of information concerning his partner and
friend, Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>The publication of the Lamon biography and the Reed
lecture brought him into a conflict from which no power on
earth could probably have kept him out, and in it he did and
said many things which for his own sake and Lincoln's he
might better not have said.</p>

<p>But Herndon was no liar. Biased as he was, and himself
a free-thinker or perhaps worse, he told the truth in such
fashion as to throw it out of perspective, and sometimes told
what he believed to be the truth in a passion which compels
us to discount some of his testimony. But he did not lie nor
intentionally misrepresent.</p>

<p>For twenty years Lincoln and Herndon were law partners,
and their partnership was never formally dissolved. Lincoln
liked Herndon, but there was no loss of love between Herndon
and Mrs. Lincoln. She, if tradition about Springfield is to
be believed, disliked him personally for his habits, and possibly
also for his politics, for he was an Abolitionist before Lincoln,
and a very ardent one at that. Had she known what Herndon
was to say about her in later years she might have been more
gracious to her husband's junior partner, who had learned
some habits at the bar of his father's tavern which he might
better not have learned.</p>

<p>Herndon in his later life looked not a little like Lincoln,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and showed no disposition by any change of beard or other
device to lessen the resemblance; but in other particulars the
two men were most unlike. Herndon was five feet nine,
Lincoln more than six feet three. Herndon was impetuous,
Lincoln extremely deliberate and cautious to a fault. Herndon
was a good judge of human nature and excelled in cross-examination,
while he failed in the careful preparation of his
cases; Lincoln was a very poor judge of human nature, but
reduced his cases to simple principles, and carefully worked
up his evidence with deliberate care. Herndon was a great
reader; Lincoln seldom read a book through. Herndon spent
his money for books and had a valuable library; Lincoln seldom
wasted a dollar on a book. Herndon was outspoken; Lincoln
was secretive. Herndon wanted all the world to know what
he thought about everything; Lincoln kept his ear to the
ground and chose his own time for the utterance of his
convictions.</p>

<p>We shall never have another as good description of
Abraham Lincoln's appearance and manner as that which
comes from the pen of Herndon, nor shall we ever obtain
better pen pictures of many of the incidents in his career.
But Herndon was too good a witness to be a good judge,
and he lived too near the stump to behold the tree.</p>

<p>Herndon had already attempted to catechize Dr. Smith,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Mr. Lincoln's pastor, concerning his relations with Lincoln,
and Smith had replied that he was willing to tell what he
knew about Lincoln's faith, but did not choose to make Mr.
Herndon his vehicle of communication to the public. This
did not tend to increase Herndon's love for the clergy: and
when Dr. Holland printed Dr. Reed's lecture, with its letters
in which several of the men whom Lamon, on Herndon's
authority, had quoted in support of Lamon's declaration,
Herndon quickly replied and Holland refused to print his
article.</p>

<p>Herndon spilled much ink through a New York newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
whose editor later was sent to prison for the circulation of
obscene literature, and wrote a number of letters, in each of
which he tended to become a little more pronounced.</p>

<p>He scorned the idea that Lincoln had taken strangers into
his confidence concerning his faith. He said in a letter to
J. E. Remsburg, under date of September 10, 1887, "He was
the most secretive, reticent, shut-mouthed man that ever
existed."</p>

<p>The Reed lecture infuriated him. He denounced Dr. Reed
publicly as a liar, and said many things which a more prudent
man would not have said. On November 9, 1882, he issued
a broadside, entitled "A Card and a Correction," beginning:</p>

<p>"I wish to say a few short words to the public and private
ear. About the year 1870 I wrote a letter to Mr. F. E. Abbott,
then of Ohio, touching Mr. Lincoln's religion.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In that letter
I stated that Mr. Lincoln was an infidel, sometimes bordering
on atheism, and I now repeat the same. In the year 1873,
the Right Rev. James A. Reed, pastor and liar of this city,
gave a lecture on Mr. Lincoln's religion, in which he tried
to answer me,&mdash;" and more to the same purport.</p>

<p>While Herndon and Lamon were men of quite different,
mind and ability, the two men used essentially the same body
of material for the making of their books about Lincoln,
Herndon having sold copies of all his Lincoln manuscripts
to Lamon.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Herndon delivered at least three lectures on Lincoln. The
first, and most popular and valuable, was on the "Life and
Character of Lincoln." It was first delivered to a Springfield
audience in 1866, was repeated many times, and it forms the
substance of the twentieth chapter of his book, as it appeared
in the first edition, and the eleventh chapter in the second.
It contains the incomparable description of Lincoln's personal
appearance which must stand to all time as the best and final
pen-picture of the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>The second was entitled "Abraham Lincoln; Miss Ann
Rutledge; New Salem; the Poem." It was delivered in the
old Sangamon County court house in Springfield in November,
1866, and was based on notes which Herndon had recently
made on a visit to New Salem, Sunday and Monday, October
14-15, 1866. It contains the material out of which all subsequent
romantic works about Lincoln and Ann Rutledge
have been woven. It was heard by a small audience, greeted
with manifest disapproval, and came near to being hopelessly
lost; but is preserved in a limited edition published by H. E.
Barker, Springfield. This edition is quoted in part in the
foregoing pages, with special reference to Herndon's personal
touch with New Salem.</p>

<p>The third was on "The Religion of Abraham Lincoln,"
and was called out by the Holland biography and the Bateman
interview. Of this and the first, Mr. Barker says in his
preface to the Ann Rutledge lecture, that they "were allowed
to perish for lack of permanence in printed form. Their
subject-matter, however, was embodied in the extended Life
of Lincoln published in 1872 by Ward H. Lamon, and in the
still later Life of Lincoln written and published by Mr. Herndon
in 1889."</p>

<p>This material is quoted practically <i>in extenso</i> in the pages
of this volume, no important statement having been omitted.</p>

<p>Herndon's regret increased that he had sold to Lamon the
copies of his papers. He was in a position where he was
getting most of the blame for what Lamon had written, and
he was not wholly in sympathy with Lamon's and especially
with Black's point of view. Lamon's proposed new edition,
with the new volume that was to have covered the years of
Lincoln's Presidency, did not materialize. There was probably
no publisher who dared undertake it. At length Herndon got
to work on his own biography of Lincoln, and was fortunate
in associating with himself Mr. Jesse W. Weik, who helped
him to complete it. The work was published in 1889 by Belford,
Clarke, &amp; Company, of Chicago, and made its appearance
in three volumes. Soon after its publication the firm
failed. The books were hawked about for a song, the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
part of the edition was unsold, and the balance of the edition
is alleged to have been bought up by Lincoln's friends and
destroyed. The author of this book paid $35.00 for his set,
and could sell it at a profit.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that Herndon had not learned his lesson
from the fate of Lamon's book. If he had omitted some of
the objectionable matter, he would have made for himself
a great name. Even as it was, he did a great piece of work:
but he gained neither money nor commendation.</p>

<p>In 1892, Appletons brought out a new edition in two
volumes, with some matter omitted, and some new matter
by Horace White, and that edition met with favor. But
Herndon did not live to see it. He died, poor and
battle-scarred, denounced as the maligner of the man he
loved.</p>

<p>In his younger days, Herndon drank, and it is alleged
that in his later life he used morphine. It is said that he
wanted an appointment to a Government Land Office, but
that Lincoln, knowing his weakness, did not appoint him, and
that this had some share in his feeling, which he still thought
to be one of reverence for Lincoln, but which was unconsciously
tinged with resentment. To this it is answered that
Lincoln did offer Herndon an appointment which Herndon
declined: but it was not a very attractive appointment, and
there is good reason to believe that Herndon was disappointed,
and that he knew Lincoln's reason.</p>

<p>The name which Herndon applied to Lincoln he accepted
for himself, that of infidel. Yet it is fair to ask whether this
was a just term as applied to Herndon himself. In his lecture
on Ann Rutledge, he had occasion to defend himself in advance
for views which he knew would be heard with suspicion, and
which, indeed, like almost everything he said and did, had
the unfortunate quality of increasing his unpopularity, he
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You know my Religion, my Philosophy: That the
highest thought and acts of the human soul and its religious
sphere are to think, love, obey, and worship God, by thinking
freely, by loving, teaching, doing good to, and elevating mankind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>My first duty is to God, then to mankind, and then to
the individual man or woman."&mdash;<i>Lecture on Ann Rutledge</i>,
pp. 9-10.</p></blockquote>

<p>One cannot help regretting that the man who had thus
defined his own religion should ever have been led to think
himself or any other man whom he supposed to be like-minded
an infidel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2></div>

<p class="c">LINCOLN'S BURNT BOOK</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the chapter on the "Conditions of Lincoln's Young Manhood
at New Salem" mention was made of the "book"
which Lincoln is said to have written, opposed to the Christian
religion, a book which his employer, Samuel Hill, is said to
have snatched from his hand and thrown into the fire lest
Lincoln's infidelity should ruin his political career. To have
treated this subject at length would have thrown that chapter
out of focus, and it is time that we should learn the truth
about it.</p>

<p>Colonel Lamon tells us about this book thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He had made himself thoroughly familiar with the writings
of Paine and Volney,&mdash;the <i>Ruins</i> by one and the <i>Age of
Reason</i> by the other. His mind was full of the subject, and
he felt an itching to write. He did write, and the result was
a 'little book.' It was probably merely an extended essay,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
but it was ambitiously spoken of as a 'book' by himself and
by the persons who were made acquainted with its contents.
In this book he intended to demonstrate,&mdash;</p>

<p class="l">
"First, that the Bible was not God's revelation; and<br />
"Secondly, that Jesus was not the Son of God."</p>
<p class="l6">
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, pp. 157-58.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lamon wrote this in 1872 of a book supposed to have been
written by Lincoln and burned by Hill in 1834.</p>

<p>We have already quoted from Herndon's account, but it
is brief and for convenience will bear reading here in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1834, while still living in New Salem and before he
became a lawyer, he was surrounded by a class of people
exceedingly liberal in matters of religion. Volney's <i>Ruins</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i> passed from hand to hand, and
furnished food for the evening's discussion in the tavern and
village store. Lincoln read both these books and thus assimilated
them into his own being. He prepared an extended
essay&mdash;called by many a book&mdash;in which he made an argument
against Christianity, striving to prove that the Bible was not
inspired, and therefore not God's revelation, and that Jesus
Christ was not the Son of God. The manuscript containing
these audacious and comprehensive propositions he intended
to have published or given a wide circulation in some other
way. He carried it to the store, where it was read and freely
discussed. His friend and employer, Samuel Hill, was among
the listeners, and seriously questioning the propriety of a
promising young man like Lincoln fathering such unpopular
notions, he snatched the manuscript from his hands and thrust
it into the stove. The book went up in flames, and Lincoln's
political future was secure."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Herndon</span>, III, 439, 440.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Herndon had already given this information to Lamon
in another form, and Lamon used it in his list of certificates
from Lincoln's old friends that Lincoln was an infidel.</p>

<p>As printed in Lamon's book, Herndon's account of the
burnt manuscript was communicated in the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to Mr. Lincoln's religious views, he was, in short,
an infidel, ... a theist. He did not believe that Jesus was
God, nor the Son of God,&mdash;was a fatalist, denied the freedom
of the will. Mr. Lincoln told me a thousand times, that he
did not believe the Bible was the revelation of God, as the
Christian world contends. The points that Mr. Lincoln tried
to demonstrate [in his book] were: First, That the Bible was
not God's revelation; and, Second, That Jesus was not the
Son of God. I assert this on my own knowledge, and on my
veracity. Judge Logan, John T. Stuart, James H. Matheny,
and others, will tell you the truth. I say they will confirm
what I say, with this exception,&mdash;they will make it blacker
than I remember it. Joshua F. Speed of Louisville, I think,
will tell you the same thing."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 489.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is important to notice that we do not have two witnesses
concerning this book, but only one. Lamon gives no evidence
of having possessed any independent knowledge of the book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
His information was derived from Herndon. In the chapter
on "Lincoln's Young Manhood" we considered how slight
was Herndon's personal connection with New Salem. The
town had vanished long before he ever visited the spot, and
apparently the only time he ever spent there for the purpose
of study was a Sunday afternoon and Monday morning,
October 14 and 15, 1866. On the occasion of that visit he
gathered the material for his lecture on Ann Rutledge. So
far as we have evidence, he learned nothing at this time about
Lincoln's burnt book. In his letter, written to be included in
Lamon's biography, in which reference to this book is made,
he says: "I assert this on my own knowledge and on my
own veracity." That sentence appears at first reading to refer
to Herndon's personal knowledge of the book, but a second
reading with the context shows that Herndon does not mean
to claim that he had personal knowledge of the book, but
personal knowledge of Lincoln's belief or the lack of it.</p>

<p>Where did Herndon learn about this book?</p>

<p>He learned it from James H. Matheny, who had never seen
the "book" but had received the information in confidence
from Lincoln. It will be remembered that Matheny repudiated
the supposed letter to Herndon which Lamon printed
as from him and said that he never wrote it, but that Herndon
compiled it from scraps of several conversations, and that it
did not represent Matheny's opinion of Lincoln's ultimate
religion. It is not necessary to suppose that either Herndon
or Lamon intended to misrepresent Matheny. Lamon had
no original documents to work from and the copy which he
received of Herndon's notes of Matheny's conversation he
took to be the copy of a letter from Matheny and printed it
as such. It appears to be quite clear that this was the only
source of Herndon's knowledge of Lincoln's burnt book. The
following is the report of these scraps of conversation with
Matheny as Herndon wrote them down and as Lamon printed
them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I knew Mr. Lincoln as early as 1834-5; know he was an
infidel. He and W. D. Herndon used to talk infidelity in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
clerk's office in this city, about the years 1837-40. Lincoln
attacked the Bible and the New Testament on two grounds:
first, from the inherent or apparent contradictions under its
lids; second, from the grounds of reason. Sometimes he
ridiculed the Bible and New Testament, sometimes seemed to
scoff it, though I shall not use that word in its full and
literal sense. I never heard that Lincoln changed his views,
though his personal and political friend from 1834 to 1860.
Sometimes Lincoln bordered on atheism. He went far that
way, and often shocked me. I was then a young man and
believed what my good mother told me. Stuart &amp; Lincoln's
office was in what was called Hoffman's Row, on North
Fifth Street, near the public square. It was in the same
building as the clerk's office, and on the same floor. Lincoln
would come into the clerk's office, where I and some young
men&mdash;Evan Butler, Newton Francis, and others&mdash;were writing
or staying, and would bring the Bible with him; would
read a chapter; argue against it. Lincoln then had a smattering
of geology, if I recollect it. Lincoln often, if not wholly,
was an atheist; at least, bordered on it. Lincoln was enthusiastic
in his infidelity. As he grew older, he grew more
discreet, didn't talk much before strangers about his religion;
but to friends, close and bosom ones, he was always open and
avowed, fair and honest; but to strangers, he held them off
from policy. Lincoln used to quote Burns. Burns helped
Lincoln to be an infidel, as I think; at least, he found in Burns
a like thinker and feeler. Lincoln quoted 'Tam o' Shanter.'
'What! send one to heaven, and ten to hell!' etc.</p>

<p>"From what I know of Mr. Lincoln and his views of
Christianity, and from what I know as honest and well-founded
rumor; from what I have heard his best friends
say and regret for years; from what he never denied when
accused, and from what Lincoln hinted and intimated, to say
no more&mdash;he did write a little book on infidelity at or near
New Salem, in Menard County, about the year 1834 or 1835.
I have stated these things to you often. Judge Logan, John
T. Stuart, yourself, know what I know, and some of you
more.</p>

<p>"Mr. Herndon, you insist on knowing something which
you know I possess, and got as a secret, and that is, about
Lincoln's little book on infidelity. Mr. Lincoln did tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that he did write a little book on infidelity. This statement
I have avoided heretofore; but, as you strongly insist upon
it,&mdash;probably to defend yourself against charges of misrepresentation,&mdash;I
give it to you as I got it from Lincoln's mouth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>,
<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, pp. 487-88.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have here our one witness that Mr. Lincoln while at
New Salem,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> freshly risen from the reading of Volney and
Paine, and having what Lamon called the "itch for writing"
wrote some kind of essay adverse to the doctrines of Christianity
as Lincoln then understood them. Matheny never
saw the book and never talked with anyone so far as we know
who had seen it, excepting Lincoln himself, who told him in
confidence that he had written such an essay. The fact that
Matheny says that he "got it as a secret" would seem to
indicate that Lincoln had no pride in it, and his reference to
Herndon's insistence indicates that Herndon had no other
source of information.</p>

<p>Lincoln did, then, write something of this character and
it may have been burned; though it is extremely doubtful
whether it met so spectacular a fate or was anything like so
formidable a document as tradition has represented it.</p>

<p>It will be noted that Colonel Matheny says nothing about
the burning of the book. Herndon got that item from some
other source, and apparently misunderstood it. This information,
apparently, Herndon picked up on the occasion of his
visit to New Salem. Samuel Hill may, indeed, have reminded
Lincoln that if he intended to run for the Legislature against
Peter Cartwright, it would be better for him not to be known
as an infidel; and indeed if Lincoln was known as an infidel,
Peter Cartwright was not the man to have failed to remind
him of it. But at the time when Samuel Hill snatched something
out of Lincoln's hand and threw it into the fire he was not
concerned so much about Lincoln's political future as he was
about something else. The document which Samuel Hill
burned contained very little about theology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>When on an evening in November, 1866, Mr. Herndon,
but lately returned from his visit to the site of New Salem,
delivered in the old court house in Springfield before a small
and critical audience his lecture on Ann Rutledge, he informed
his hearers that in 1834 that sweet young girl of nineteen
was simultaneously loved by three men, one of whom was
Abraham Lincoln. He omitted the names of the other two,
and filled in their place in the manuscript with blanks. The
world has long since learned the other two names, of John
McNamur and Samuel Hill. Herndon's reason for concealing
them at the time was probably the fact that their descendants
were living near, but those descendants are well aware of it
now, and have been for years.</p>

<p>Hill and McNamur were partners, and Ann loved McNamur
and rejected Hill. McNamur went East, and was
gone so long that it was believed he was either dead or had
proved untrue, and Hill's hope lit up again only to meet a
second disappointment. Ann Rutledge still loved McNamur,
but, believing him forever lost to her, she had made her
second choice, and that choice was not Hill. Hill awoke to the
sad discovery that having once been refused for his partner's
sake he was refused again for the sake of his clerk. This
shy, gawky, lank, and ill-mannered young fellow who was
selling goods in Hill's store and studying law and cherishing
all manner of ambitions had aspired to the hand of Ann
Rutledge and had been accepted.</p>

<p>The truth about it came out in the discovery of a letter
which Hill had written to McNamur. Hill was making one
last effort to learn whether McNamur was living or dead,
and if living whether he still loved Ann; and was reproaching
him for his delay and neglect. This letter did not find its
way to the post office; in some way it was lost and was picked
up by the children who brought it to Lincoln. This was the
document which Lincoln held in his hand when he and Hill
came to their final reckoning concerning the heart of Ann
Rutledge; and the argument between them, while friendly,
developed some heat, and that was what Hill snatched from
Lincoln's hand and threw into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the book or essay or whatever it may have been in
which Lincoln passed on his undigested reading of Volney and
Paine, we do not know what became of that, nor need we
greatly care. It went the way of a good deal of literature
which Lincoln was producing at this time, probably with no
dream that any of it would ever see a printing-press. It is
hardly credible that Lincoln, who never printed a book even
in his maturer years, should have had serious purpose of
printing this particular bit of half-fledged philosophy.</p>

<p>But we have knowledge, and very direct knowledge, of
something else which Lincoln wrote at this time. We learn
of it not by any such circuitous route of hearsay evidence
as accompanies the story of the so-called book on infidelity.
We learn of it from a man who received it at Lincoln's hands
and who read it and remembered its contents and was a competent
witness not only as to the production of the book, but
also as to its argument. This is none other than Mentor
Graham, the schoolmaster of New Salem, who introduced
Lincoln to Kirkham's Grammar, who taught Lincoln surveying,
who had Lincoln in his home as a lodger, and who
knew more about Lincoln's religious views during his years
at New Salem than any other man who lived to tell the world
about it after Lincoln's death. In Irwin's article, which we
have already quoted, is found this letter from Mentor
Graham.</p>

<p>Mentor Graham is a much better witness than either
Mr. Herndon or Colonel Matheny,&mdash;better because equally
honest, and a man of less violent prejudices and of more sober
habits, and especially because he had direct personal knowledge
of the facts. In his letter to Mr. Irwin, under date of March
17, 1874, Mentor Graham relates that when Lincoln was
living in Graham's house in New Salem in 1833, studying
English grammar and surveying under this good schoolmaster,
Lincoln one morning said to him:</p>

<p>"Graham, what do you think of the anger of the Lord?"</p>

<p>Graham replied, "I believe the Lord never was angry or
mad, and never will be; that His loving kindness endureth
forever, and that He never changes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Lincoln said, "I have a little manuscript written which
I will show you."</p>

<p>The manuscript was written on foolscap paper, about a
half-quire in size, and was written in a plain hand. Mentor
read it.</p>

<p>"It was a defense of universal salvation. The commencement
of it was something about the God of the universe never
being excited, mad, or angry. I had the manuscript in my
possession some week or ten days. I have read many books
on the subject, and I don't think in point of perspicacity and
plainness of reasoning I ever read one to surpass it. I remember
well his argument. He took the passage, 'As in Adam
all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,' and followed
with the proposition that whatever the breach or injury of
Adam's transgression to the human race was, which no doubt
was very great, was made right by the atonement of Christ."</p>

<p>On this point, then, we have abundant witness. Lincoln
argued from the fall of man to the redemptive work of Christ
as the Baptist preachers were in the habit of doing, but instead
of finding there the basis of an argument for individual election
and particular salvation or damnation, found in it the
basis of faith in universal salvation.</p>

<p>How Lincoln can have reconciled this kind of reasoning
with his readings from Thomas Paine can be understood by
those who have read Paine&mdash;which most men who discuss
him have not&mdash;and who know the form of argument of the
backwoods preachers which Lincoln had known all his life
and little else in the way of reasoned discourse in spiritual
things. His line of argument was a not unnatural resultant
of the forces at work in his mind.</p>

<p>But what about the book which Hill burned?</p>

<p>Here again we have the personal knowledge of Mentor
Graham. He was not, indeed, actually present when the
manuscript was burned. No one, probably, was present,
except Hill and Lincoln. But Graham was very much nearer
to the event in point both of time and distance than either
Herndon or Matheny, from whom Herndon learned about it,
and learned incorrectly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>What Hill snatched from Lincoln's hand and burned was
a letter which Hill had written to McNamur about Ann Rutledge.
The letter was lost and picked up by the school children,
who brought it to Lincoln, the postmaster. Lincoln,
knowing Hill's handwriting, and guessing the nature of the
letter, kept it to discuss with Hill alone; and they did discuss
it together. Hill was demanding of McNamur that he either
come back to New Salem, or release Ann Rutledge from her
engagement; and what he learned was, that his successful
rival was not now McNamur, but Lincoln. Here is what
Graham says about it:</p>

<p>"Some of the school children had picked up the letter and
handed it to Lincoln. Hill and Lincoln were talking about
it, when Hill snatched the letter from Lincoln and put it into
the fire. The letter was respecting a young lady, Miss Ann
Rutledge, for whom all three of these gentlemen seemed to
have respect."</p>

<p>Graham lived in New Salem at the time that this incident
occurred. Neither Herndon nor Matheny lived there. Graham
left New Salem when it ceased to be a town, and spent
the remainder of his life among the people who had been
his neighbors in New Salem and who became residents with
him in the near-by town of Petersburg. Graham had direct
access to the facts.</p>

<p>The reason why it was not much talked about is evident
enough. Hill, McNamur, and Lincoln all married, and their
wives and children were living not far from where these
events occurred. The triangular misunderstanding of three
young men about a young woman who had died many years
before was a matter for quiet gossip on the part of the older
inhabitants, but it did not come to the general knowledge of
the public until Herndon delivered his unwelcome lecture on
Ann Rutledge. In some things he learned and told the truth.
But his material had been too hastily gathered, and was too
quickly rushed into a lecture to be reliable in all respects,
and it requires about four titles to cover its diversified and
unstratified subject-matter.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the burnt book is, therefore, a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in which we come finally to the remote recollection of James
Matheny on the one hand, who never saw the book, and who
manifestly misunderstood some parts of the story, and the close
and intimate knowledge of Mentor Graham on the other.
Lincoln apparently told Matheny in confidence that he while
he was living in Salem wrote an essay against the Christian
religion, and Matheny regarded it as a secret but told it to
Herndon. Herndon heard some gossip about a manuscript
which Hill burned, and thought it to have been the same.
Mentor Graham had reliable information as to what it was
that Hill burned, and moreover knew from his own personal
knowledge that Lincoln wrote a very different manuscript
than the one of which he told Matheny, for he himself had
read it, and remembered its general nature.</p>

<p>Why Lincoln wrote on both sides of the same subject we
do not know and it is not necessary to ask. He may have
been practicing his skill in debating; he may have held one
view at one time and another at another; he may have been
uncertain what view he really held and have been seeking to
formulate his opinions. It would not be fair to judge his
mature opinion by our scant knowledge of what was contained
in either of these two manuscripts. But the thing which
should be remembered is that we know more about the book
in favor of Christianity than we know of the book against it.
Mentor Graham was a truthful and a competent witness and
he had both seen and read the book, which is not true of
anyone through whom we have knowledge of the other essay.</p>

<p>We are not at liberty to draw the sharp distinction which
sometimes has been drawn against the rampant infidelity of
Lincoln's earlier years and the supposed orthodoxy of his
mature life. Neither of these may have been as hard and
fast as have sometimes been assumed. It is quite possible
that Abraham Lincoln never became a Christian of the type
who could have expressed his faith in the terms of the Bateman
interview; it is equally possible that even in those callow years
when he was reading Tom Paine and Volney and writing sub-sophomoric
effusions on things he knew little about, the germ
of religious faith was actually present even in his doubt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>

<p class="c">"THE CHRISTIAN'S DEFENCE"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the spring of the year 1850, after the death of their little
son Eddie, Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln visited Mrs. Lincoln's
relatives in Kentucky. While they were on this visit, Mr.
Lincoln picked up a book entitled <i>The Christian's Defence</i>, by
Rev. James Smith. He was interested, for Dr. Smith was a
townsman of his, and in the absence of Mrs. Lincoln's rector
Dr. Smith had conducted the little boy's funeral service in
the Lincoln home. Lincoln read a part but not the whole of
the book while on this visit. Dr. Smith, as the book showed,
had himself been a doubter, but had become convinced of the
truth of the Christian religion, and had become a valiant
defender of the faith, and an eager debater with skeptics. Out
of a three weeks' discussion with one of these this book had
grown.</p>

<p>On his return to Springfield Mr. Lincoln took occasion
to secure the book, and to cultivate a closer acquaintance with
its author.</p>

<p>Lincoln found him well worth knowing; and the reader
of this book deserves an introduction to him and his work.</p>

<p>I have obtained from Miss Jeanette E. Smith, of Springfield,
granddaughter of Rev. James Smith, a considerable body
of manuscript and other material relating to her grandfather.</p>

<p>James Smith was born in Glasgow, Scotland, May 11,
1801, and died in Scotland July 3, 1871. He was the son of
Peter and Margaret Smith. In youth he was wild, and in
his opinions was a deist; but when converted he became a
fearless defender of the faith. He was a big, brainy man,
with a great voice and with positive convictions. He was
called from Shelbyville, Kentucky, to the First Church of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Springfield, his pastorate beginning March 14, 1849, and
closing December 17, 1856.</p>

<p>He was a strong temperance man. His sermon on "The
Bottle, Its Evils and Its Remedy," from Habakkuk 2:15, was
preached on January 23, 1853, and printed at the request of
thirty-nine men who heard it, Abraham Lincoln being one of
those who signed the request. "Friends of Temperance"
they called themselves. I have a copy of this remarkable
sermon. In one part it essayed a vindication of the distiller
and liquor-seller, affirming that a community that licensed
them had no right to abuse them for doing what they had paid
for the privilege of doing; and that the State with money in its
pocket received as a share in the product of drunkenness had
no right to condemn the saloonkeeper for his share in the
partnership. He called on the Legislature then in session
to pass a prohibitory law, forbidding all sale of intoxicating
liquor except for medical, mechanical, and sacramental
purposes.</p>

<p>Such sermons became abundant forty years afterward,
but they were not abundant in 1853. Dr. Smith was one of
the men who held these convictions, and Abraham Lincoln
was one of the men who wanted to see them printed and
circulated.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that all knowledge of the massive book
which Dr. Smith wrote and published should have perished
from Springfield. Lamon manifestly knew nothing of it as
a book, but thought of it as a manuscript tract, prepared
especially for the ambitious business of converting Mr. Lincoln.
His sarcastic description implies this, and Herndon, who
may have known better at the time, had apparently forgotten.
Both men were disqualified for the discussion of it
by their ignorance of it, as well as the violence of their prejudice.</p>

<p>On February 12, 1909, a service was held in the old First
Presbyterian Church in Springfield, then occupied by the
Lutherans, the Presbyterians having erected a larger building.
The address was given by Rev. Thomas D. Logan, Dr. Smith's
successor, whose pastorate had begun in 1888. In all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
more than twenty years of his ministry in Springfield, he
had never seen this book. He had never known of it as a
book at the time he wrote the first draft of this centenary
address. The substance of the address he sent in advance
as an article for the Lincoln Number of <i>The Continent</i> in
February, 1909; but in the revision of the proof he inserted
a footnote saying that Dr. Smith's granddaughter, Miss
Jeanette E. Smith, had come into possession of a copy of
her grandfather's book, which he had just seen.</p>

<p>The prime reason for this complete ignorance of the book,
even in the church which Lincoln attended, is that it was
published six years before Dr. Smith came to Springfield, in a
limited edition, and completely sold out before it came from
the press; so that it never came into general circulation in
Springfield.</p>

<p>Miss Smith has placed at my disposal her own copy of this
book, which was her grandfather's, and I have been able
to locate about a half-dozen copies in various public libraries,
and by rare good fortune to buy one for myself.</p>

<p>Dr. Smith's statement was made in a letter from Cainno,
Scotland, dated January 24, 1867:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was my honor to place before Mr. Lincoln arguments
designed to prove the divine authority and inspiration of
the Scriptures, accompanied by the arguments of infidel objectors
in their own language. To the arguments on both sides
Mr. Lincoln gave a most patient, impartial, and searching
investigation. To use his own language, he examined the
arguments as a lawyer who is anxious to investigate truth
investigates testimony. The result was the announcement
made by himself that the argument in favor of the divine
authority and inspiration of the Scriptures was unanswerable."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rev.
James A. Reed</span>: "The Later Life and Religious
Sentiments of Abraham Lincoln," <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, July,
1873, p. 333.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Thomas Lewis, a lawyer whose office adjoined that
of Mr. Lincoln in Springfield, and who for a time was in the
same office, was an elder in the church which Lincoln attended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
In 1898 he wrote his recollections of Dr. Smith's book and
its influence upon Mr. Lincoln:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was an elder, trustee, treasurer, collector, superintendent
of the Sunday school, and pew-renter. The following Tuesday,
after the second Sunday, Mr. Lincoln called on me and
inquired if there were any pews to rent in the church. I
replied, 'Yes, and a very desirable one, vacated by Governor
Madison, who has just left the city.' 'What is the rent?'
said he. 'Fifty dollars, payable quarterly.' He handed me
$12.50. Said he, 'Put it down to me.' From that date he
paid each three months on said pew until he left for Washington;
and from the first Sunday he was there I have not
known of his not occupying that pew every Sunday he was
in the city until he left. The seat was immediately in front
of mine. The third Sunday his children came in the Sunday
school.</p>

<p>"Shortly thereafter there was a revival in the church,
and Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln, when he was in the city, attended
meeting. In his absence she was there. They attended not
only the regular meetings, but the inquiry meetings also, and
it was the belief that both would unite with the church. When
the candidates were examined Mr. Lincoln was in Detroit,
prosecuting a patent right case, a branch of the profession
in which he had acquired an enviable reputation. Mrs. Lincoln
stated that she was confirmed in the Episcopal Church
when twelve years of age, but did not wish to join the church
by letter, but upon profession of faith, as she was never
converted until Dr. Smith's preaching. She was admitted
[1852]. Mr. Lincoln never applied. Some months later the
session of the church invited Mr. Lincoln to deliver a lecture
on the Bible. When it became known that Mr. Lincoln was
to lecture in the Presbyterian church it assured a full house.
It was said by divines and others to be the ablest defense of
the Bible ever uttered in that pulpit.</p>

<p>"From the introduction of Mr. Lincoln to Dr. Smith
their intimacy was of a most cordial character. At their
last meeting previous to Mr. Lincoln's leaving for Washington,
as they parted, Mr. Lincoln said, 'Doctor, I wish to
be remembered in the prayers of yourself and our church
members.'"&mdash;<i>Illinois State Register</i>, December 10, 1898.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>A very interesting bit of testimony to the relations of Mr.
Lincoln and his pastor, Dr. Smith, was given by Rev. William
Bishop, D.D., in an address at Salina, Kansas, on February
12, 1897, and published in the local papers at the time. Dr.
Bishop was graduated from Illinois College in 1850, and for
a time was a member of the faculty there. In the summer
after his graduation, he supplied Dr. Smith's pulpit during
his vacation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I first met Dr. Smith in the summer of 1850 in Jacksonville,
at the commencement exercises of Illinois College, from
which I had graduated and had just been appointed a member
of the faculty of instruction. The acquaintance then formed
ripened into mutual and congenial friendship. And during
the two years of my connection with the college I was frequently
a visitor and guest at his house in Springfield, and
when, by reason of removal to another institution in another
State, the visits were fewer and farther between, 'a free
epistolary correspondence' continued to strengthen and
brighten the links of fellowship. With his other accomplishments,
Dr. Smith was an interesting and instructive conversationalist&mdash;in
fact, quite a raconteur, somewhat like his friend
Lincoln, always ready with a story to illustrate his opinions,
and which gave piquancy to his conversation. Whenever he
had occasion to speak of Lincoln he always evinced the
strongest attachment and the warmest friendship for him,
which was known to be fully reciprocated. Democrat as he
was, and tinged with Southern hues&mdash;though never a secessionist&mdash;there
seemed to be a mystic cord uniting the minister
and the lawyer. This was subsequently beautifully shown
on the part of Mr. Lincoln, who never forgot to do a generous
thing. When he was elected President Dr. Smith and wife
were getting old, their children all married and gone, except
their youngest<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> son, a young man of twenty-three or four
years of age. One of Lincoln's first official acts, after his
inauguration, was the appointment of this young man to the
consulate at Dundee, Scotland. The doctor, with his wife and
son, returned to the land of his birth. The son soon returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to America, and Dr. Smith himself was appointed consul,
which position he retained until his death in 1871.</p>

<p>"In the spring of 1857 Dr. Smith, anticipating a necessary
absence from his church of two or three months during the
summer, invited me to supply his pulpit until his return.
Being young and inexperienced in the ministry, with considerable
hesitation I accepted his urgent invitation. So I
spent my college vacation performing as best I could this
service. Mr. Lincoln was a regular attendant at church and
evidently an attentive hearer and devout worshiper.</p>

<p>"As a college student I had seen and heard him and looked
up to him as a being towering above common men; and, I
confess, I was not a little intimidated by his presence as he
sat at the end of a seat well forward toward the pulpit, with
his deep eyes fixed upon me, and his long legs stretched out
in the middle aisle to keep them from [using one of his own
colloquialisms] being scrouged in the narrow space between
the pews. My 'stage fright,' however, was soon very much
relieved by his kindliness and words of encouragement.</p>

<p>"On a certain Sunday, the third, as I recollect it, in my
term of service, I delivered a discourse on the text, 'Without
God in the World.' The straight translation from the Greek
is, 'Atheists in the World.' In discussing atheism, theoretical
and practical, I endeavored to elucidate and enforce the fallacy
of the one and the wickedness of the other. At the close of
the service Mr. Lincoln came up and, putting his right hand
in mine and his left on my shoulder, with other impressive
remarks, said, 'I can say "Amen" to all that you have said
this morning.' From that time on my interest in him grew
apace.</p>

<p>"He was then known extensively all over the West as a
great and good man, and only a year afterward he bounded
into national fame by his victory in the great debate with
Douglas, who, up to that time, was regarded as a debater
invincible.</p>

<p>"During my brief sojourn in Springfield I had many
opportunities of meeting Lincoln, hearing him, and talking
with him at home, in church, in society, and in the courts
of justice.</p>

<p>"Dr. Smith returned in due time to resume his pastoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
functions. In reporting to him, in general, my labors in the
church as his substitute during his absence, and in particular
my conceptions of Lincoln's religious character, he intimated
that he knew something of Lincoln's private personal religious
experiences, feelings, and beliefs which resulted in his conversion
to the Christian faith. After some urging to be
more explicit, he made the following statement, which is
herewith submitted, couched substantially in his own language.
The doctor said:</p>

<p>"'I came to Springfield to take the pastoral charge of
this church [First Presbyterian] about eight years ago
[1849]. During the first of these years, I might say, I had
only a speaking or general acquaintance with Mr. Lincoln
[then forty years old]. Two or three years previous to my
coming here Mrs. Lincoln, who had been a member of our
church, for some reason changed her church relations and was
a regular attendant at the services of the Episcopal Church.
Mr. Lincoln, at that time, having no denominational preferences,
went with her. And so the family continued to frequent
the sanctuary for a year or more after I began my
ministry here. The occasion which opened up the way to my
intimate relations to Mr. Lincoln was this, viz.: In the latter
part of 1849 death came into his family. His second son
died at about three or four years of age. The rector, an
excellent clergyman, being temporarily absent, could not be
present to conduct the burial service, and I was called to
officiate at the funeral. This led me to an intimate acquaintance
with the family, and grew into an enduring and confidential
friendship between Mr. Lincoln and myself. One
result was that the wife and mother returned to her ancestral
church, and the husband and father very willingly came with
her, and ever since has been a constant attendant upon my
ministry. I found him very much depressed and downcast
at the death of his son, and without the consolation of the
gospel. Up to this time I had heard but little concerning
his religious views, and that was to the effect that he was a
deist and inclined to skepticism as to the divine origin of the
Scriptures, though, unlike most skeptics, he had evidently been
a constant reader of the Bible. I found him an honest and
anxious inquirer. He gradually revealed the state of his
mind and heart, and at last unbosomed his doubts and struggles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and unrest of soul. In frequent conversations I found that
he was perplexed and unsettled on the fundamentals of
religion, by speculative difficulties, connected with Providence
and revelation, which lie beyond and above the legitimate province
of religion. With some suggestions bearing on the
right attitude required for impartial investigation, I placed in
his hands my book (<i>The Christian's Defence</i>) on the evidence
of Christianity, which gives the arguments for and against
the divine authority and inspiration of the Holy Scriptures.
Mr. Lincoln took the book, and for a number of weeks, as
a lawyer, examined and weighed the evidence, pro and con,
and judged of the credibility of the contents of revelation.
And while he was investigating I was praying that the Spirit
of Truth might lead him into the kingdom of truth. And
such was the result, for at the conclusion of his examination
he came forth his doubts scattered to the winds and his reason
convinced by the arguments in support of the inspired and
infallible authority of the Old and New Testaments&mdash;a believer
in God, in His providential government, in His Son, the way,
the truth, and the life, and from that time [nearly seven years]
to this day his life has proved the genuineness of his conversion
to the Christian faith. For this I humbly ascribe to our
heavenly Father the honor and the glory.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>In an earlier statement than that previously quoted, Mr.
Thomas Lewis, under date of January 6, 1873, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Not long after Dr. Smith came to Springfield, and I
think very near the time of his son's death, Mr. Lincoln said
to me that when on a visit somewhere he had seen and partially
read a work of Dr. Smith on the evidences of Christianity,
which had led him to change his view of the Christian
religion, and he would like to get that work and finish the
reading of it, and also to make the acquaintance of Dr. Smith.
I was an elder in Dr. Smith's church, and took Dr. Smith to
Mr. Lincoln's office, and Dr. Smith gave Mr. Lincoln a copy
of his book, as I know, at his own request."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a very different story from that which Lamon
tells, of a self-advertising preacher, ostentatiously preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
a tract to convert Mr. Lincoln, and thrusting it upon him
uninvited and thereafter to be neglected.</p>

<p>That Mr. Lincoln was impressed by the book is as certain
as human testimony can make it. He told Dr. Smith that he
regarded its argument as "unanswerable," and Lamon's slighting
remark will not stand against so emphatic a word.</p>

<p>Moreover, Hon. John T. Stuart, whom Lamon had quoted
as saying, "The Rev. Dr. Smith, who wrote a letter, tried
to convert Lincoln as late as 1858, and couldn't do it," repudiated
that statement, declared he never had said it; and on the
contrary affirmed that he understood from those who had
reason to know that Dr. Smith's book had produced a change
in the mind of Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>Ninian W. Edwards, Mr. Lincoln's brother-in-law, on
December 24, 1872, entered the discussion with this emphatic
statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A short time after the Rev. Dr. Smith became pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church in this city, Mr. Lincoln
said to me, 'I have been reading a work of Dr. Smith on the
evidences of Christianity, and have heard him preach and
converse on the subject, and am now convinced of the truth
of the Christian religion.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Just what doctrines he was convinced were true, we may
not know. But we do know that he requested the book and
declared it unanswerable, that he and his wife changed their
church affiliation and he became a regular attendant, that Dr.
Smith became his friend and was honored and recognized by
him as long as Lincoln lived, and that those who knew Lincoln
best were told by him that some change had come in his
own belief.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, the word and work of Rev. James
Smith are not to be thrown unceremoniously out of court.
They have standing in any fair consideration of the question
of Lincoln's religious faith.</p>

<p>I have looked through many Lives of Lincoln to discover
whether any biographer of Lincoln had ever looked up this
book, and thus far have not discovered any. I have inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
for the book at the Chicago Historical Library and the Illinois
Historical Library, and neither of those libraries contains it,
nor had it been thought of in connection with Lincoln. Mr.
Oldroyd does not have it in his matchless collection, where
I hoped I might find the veritable copy that Lincoln read, and
he had never heard of it; nor does the matron of the Lincoln
Home at Springfield know anything about it.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>I shall give in the Appendix of this book an outline of
the contents of Dr. Smith's solid work, that the reader may
judge for himself whether such a book, placed in the hands
of Mr. Lincoln at such a time, may not have had upon his
mind all the influence that Dr. Smith ever claimed for it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>

<p class="c">"VESTIGES OF CREATION"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> was a man of few books. Much has been made of
the fact that when a lad he eagerly read every book within
reach; but he did not continue that habit in his mature years.
Something happened to the lad in adolescence that changed him
mentally as well as physically. His sudden upshoot in stature
permanently tired him; he became disinclined to activity. His
movements were much slower, and his habits of thought more
sluggish. Arnold attempts to make a list of his "favorite
books," but does not make much progress (<i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
pp. 443, 444). About all there is to be said is that he read
the Bible both as a boy and man, and came to have an appreciation
and love of Shakspeare, particularly <i>Hamlet</i> and
<i>Macbeth</i>, but he never read Shakspeare through. He was fond
of some of the poems of Burns, the rollicking humor of
"Tam o' Shanter," the withering scorn&mdash;an element which
had a considerable place in Lincoln's nature&mdash;of "Holy Willie's
Prayer," the manly democracy of "A Man's a Man for a'
That"; but he never quoted Burns. He had little appreciation
of music, but liked negro melodies&mdash;not the genuine ones,
but the minstrel-show sort&mdash;camp-meeting ballads, Scotch
songs, and mournful narrative compositions, of which the
woods were moderately full in his boyhood, and which he
continued to enjoy. Broadly humorous songs moved him to
mirth, but he cared more for those that were sad. Everyone
knows his love for the mediocre but melodious poem, "O
Why Should the Spirit of Mortal be Proud," which like the
religious song he loved, "How tedious and tasteless the
hours," moved mournfully in triple time, flaunting crêpe in
the face of the spirit of the waltz. About the only contemporary
poem which he is known to have cared much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
was Holmes' "Last Leaf," in which he was particularly
moved by the lines,&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Herndon is correct in saying that Lincoln read less and
thought more than any man prominent in public life in his
generation.</p>

<p>But the few books that Lincoln read in his mature years
affected him greatly; and when we know of his reading a
book because he cared for it, we may well endeavor to discover
that book and inquire whether it be not possible to trace its
influence in the development, slow but sure, of the mental and
spiritual processes of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>A highly important statement concerning the philosophical
and religious views of Lincoln is found in Herndon's <i>Life of
Lincoln</i>, and it is remarkable that neither Herndon nor any of
the hundreds of writers who have gleaned, as all must glean,
from his pages, appears to have followed further the most
important of its suggestions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For many years I subscribed for and kept on our office
table the <i>Westminster</i> and <i>Edinburgh Review</i> and a number of
other English periodicals. Besides them, I purchased the
works of Spencer, Darwin, and the utterances of other English
scientists, all of which I devoured with great relish. I endeavored,
but with little success, in inducing Lincoln to read
them. Occasionally he would snatch one up and peruse it for
a little while, but he soon threw it down with the suggestion
that it was entirely too heavy for an ordinary mind to digest.
A gentleman in Springfield gave him a book called, I believe,
<i>Vestiges of Creation</i>, which interested him so much that he
read it through. The volume was published in Edinburgh, and
undertook to demonstrate the doctrine of development, or evolution.
The treatise interested him greatly, and he was deeply
impressed with the notion of the so-called 'universal law'
evolution; he did not extend greatly his researches, but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
continual thinking in a single channel seemed to grow into a
warm advocate of the new doctrine. Beyond what I have
stated he made no further advances into the realm of philosophy.
'There are no accidents,' he said one day, 'in my philosophy.
Every effect must have its cause. The past is the
cause of the present, and the present will be the cause of the
future. All these are links in the endless chain stretching from
the Infinite to the finite.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Herndon</span>, III, 438.</p></blockquote>

<p>I count it remarkable that neither Herndon nor any other
of Lincoln's biographers appears to have made further inquiry
about this book, which is not mentioned in Herndon's index,
and which I have not found referred to elsewhere in connection
with Lincoln. The book is not in any of the great Lincoln
collections which I have visited, nor has any Lincoln student
to whom I have mentioned it had it in mind, or failed to be
impressed with the value of it when we have discussed the
matter.</p>

<p>The book itself is not in the Lincoln Home at Springfield,
nor is it in the Oldroyd Collection at Washington, in one of
which places I hoped that it might be found. Neither the
librarian of the Illinois Historical Society in Springfield, nor
Mr. Barker, the painstaking and discriminating collector and
vendor of Lincoln books in Springfield, had ever noticed the
title in Herndon's book, though both were at once impressed
with its significance when I called it to their attention.</p>

<p>The material in Herndon's lectures on Lincoln is pretty
well absorbed in his book, and quoted in this volume; but there
are some interesting additional details in Herndon's letters.
In these, answering specific questions or replying to definite
statements, he now and then added a statement which was not
later included in his book, but which has present interest and
in some cases value.</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from a letter of Herndon to
John E. Remsburg, and bears in an important way on Lincoln's
use of <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had an excellent private library, probably the best in the
city for admired books. To this library Mr. Lincoln had, as
a matter of course, full and free access at all times. I p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>urchased
such books as Locke, Kant, Fichte, Lewes; Sir William
Hamilton's <i>Discussions of Philosophy</i>; Spencer's <i>First Principles</i>,
<i>Social Studies</i>, etc.; Buckle's <i>History of Civilization</i>,
and Lecky's <i>History of Rationalism</i>. I also possessed the
works of Parker, Paine, Emerson and Strauss; Gregg's <i>Creed
of Christendom</i>, McNaught on <i>Inspiration</i>, Volney's <i>Ruins</i>,
Feuerbach's <i>Essence of Christianity</i>, and other works on Infidelity.
Mr. Lincoln read some of these works. About the
year 1843<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> he borrowed the <i>Vestiges of Creation</i> of Mr.
James W. Keys, of this city, and read it carefully. He subsequently
read the sixth edition of this work, which I loaned him.
He adopted the progressive and development theory as taught
more or less directly in that work. He despised speculation,
especially in the metaphysical world. He was purely a practical
man."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Remsburg</span>: <i>Six Historic Americans</i>, pp. 114-15.</p></blockquote>

<p>As already stated Dr. Smith's book <i>The Christian's Defence</i>
is excessively rare. The edition was small; the argument
which it contained was modified with the progress of
discovery; there was little to keep in circulation the few copies
of the book that survived. They have nearly all disappeared.
I have searched the second-hand shops of the principal cities
and the dusty duplicates of libraries with repeated disappointment.
For this reason, I have carried a complete analysis of
the book into the Appendix of this volume; for few who read
the present volume will be able to see the book itself.</p>

<p>It is quite otherwise with <i>Vestiges of the Natural History
of Creation</i>. It was widely circulated, and copies of even the
older editions are not impossible to obtain. It can be purchased,
new, at very small cost.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But most of the editions
that the reader will be likely to find, if he seeks for them, are
later than the one which influenced Lincoln, and contain more
or less of supplementary matter.</p>

<p>Before passing to another subject, it will be well to say a
further word about this book, for a fuller discussion of which
one may go to Andrew D. White's <i>Conflict of Science with
Theology</i> and other learned works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of this book was Robert Chambers,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> one of the
famous firm of publishers, and himself an author of note.
He was born in Peebles, Scotland, July 10, 1802, and died
at St. Andrews, March 17, 1871. He was an author as well
as publisher of books. He published this book anonymously,
and its authorship was not known for forty years. In 1884,
thirteen years after his death, his name appeared for the first
time upon the title page of a new edition.</p>

<p>It was, in the author's own phrase, "the first attempt to
connect the natural sciences with the history of creation."</p>

<p>From it Lincoln learned geology and comparative biology.
In it he found not only studies of the rocks, but also of the
prenatal life of man, as related in its successive stages to corresponding
types in the geological world. It was, in a word,
an introduction to Darwin, which appeared many years later.</p>

<p>That many ministers denounced it as contradictory to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Bible we know, and the author anticipated this, nor is this a
matter which gives us present concern. Some ministers believed
it, and others, still unconvinced, read it with an open
mind and waited for more light.</p>

<p>The important thing for us to know and clearly recognize
is that in this book Abraham Lincoln not only learned what
Herndon considers, and we are justified in considering, the
essential theory of evolution, but he learned that such a view
of creation is consistent with faith in God and the Bible.</p>

<p>We shall not find it possible to overestimate the importance
of this discovery. Abraham Lincoln wrought out his philosophy
of creation, his scheme of cause and effect, his theory of
the processes of nature and life, under influences not atheistic
nor hostile to religion, but distinctly favorable to it. He
learned of evolution, and was convinced of its truth, from a
book whose spirit and purpose was to present the view in
harmony with the Christian faith.</p>

<p>The second, and subsequent editions, of <i>Vestiges</i> were
"Greatly Amended by the Author," as the title page gave
notice, and the changes were partly to incorporate new scientific
data, but more to make clear the fact that the author's
theory did not remove God from his universe, as some critics
had asserted, but like Butler's <i>Analogy</i> had shown that God is
in His world, working through the processes of nature. In
1846 appeared <i>Explanations: A Sequel to Vestiges of the
Natural History of Creation</i>, a thin volume added to carry still
further this double purpose, and doing it with marked success.
The sixth edition combined the two in one volume.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn that Lincoln, having read the first
edition, later procured and read the sixth, in which the religious
spirit of the author was made still more apparent.</p>

<p>This was the book which gave to Lincoln his theory of
creation, of "miracles under law," and with one divine mind
and purpose working through it all. Lincoln read little of
natural science and cared practically nothing for philosophy,
but he found in this book what he needed of both; and he
found them in a system whose soul and center was the will
of a righteous God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2></div>

<p class="c">OTHER FORMATIVE BOOKS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> do not know of any other books which deserve to be
classed with the two we have been considering in their relation
to the formation of Mr. Lincoln's religious ideas; but our
inquiry is at a point where it will be instructive to learn of any
collateral influence which at this period, the period of the 50's,
after the death of Eddie, and before his election as President,
helped to give shape to his convictions.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln did not unite with Dr. Smith's church. It is
difficult to think that it would have been possible for him to
have done so. Old-school Calvinism had its permanent influence
upon him through his Baptist antecedents, but while
that of Dr. Smith came to him most opportunely, it did not
wholly meet his spiritual requirements.</p>

<p>For many years Herndon was in regular correspondence
with Theodore Parker. They agreed in their view of the
slavery question, and had much in common in their religion.
Herndon had Parker's theological books, and Lincoln read
them, not very thoroughly, perhaps, but with interest.</p>

<p>About the same time, Mr. Jesse W. Fell, for whom he
wrote the first sketch of his life, presented him with the works
of William E. Channing.</p>

<p>When Herndon was gathering material to confute Dr.
Reed, he assembled very nearly everything that seemed to
prove that Lincoln was not orthodox, however far short it fell
of proving him an infidel. Among the rest he interviewed
Fell, and from his statements made up this report, which appeared
in Lamon's book, and subsequently in Herndon's:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Jesse W. Fell of Illinois, who had the best opportunities
of knowing Mr. Lincoln intimately, makes the follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>ing
statement of his religious opinions, derived from repeated
conversations with him on the subject:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Though everything relating to the character and history
of this extraordinary personage is of interest, and should be
fairly stated to the world, I enter upon the performance of this
duty&mdash;for so I regard it&mdash;with some reluctance, arising from
the fact, that, in stating my convictions on the subject, I must
necessarily place myself in opposition to quite a number who
have written on this topic before me, and whose views largely
preoccupy the public mind. This latter fact, whilst contributing
to my embarrassment on this subject, is, perhaps, the
strongest reason, however, why the truth in this matter should
be fully disclosed; and I therefore yield to your request. If
there were any traits of character that stood out in bold relief
in the person of Mr. Lincoln, they were those of truth and
candor. He was utterly incapable of insincerity, or professing
views on this or any other subject he did not entertain.
Knowing such to be his true character, that insincerity, much
more duplicity, were traits wholly foreign to his nature, many
of his old friends were not a little surprised at finding, in
some of the biographies of this great man, statements concerning
his religious opinions so utterly at variance with his known
sentiments. True, he may have changed or modified those
sentiments after his removal from among us, though this is
hardly reconcilable with the history of the man, and his entire
devotion to public matters during his four years' residence at
the national capital. It is possible, however, that this may
be the proper solution of this conflict of opinions; or, it may
be, that, with no intention on the part of anyone to mislead the
public mind, those who have represented him as believing in
the popular theological views of the times may have misapprehended
him, as experience shows to be quite common
where no special effort has been made to attain critical accuracy
on a subject of this nature. This is the more probable
from the well-known fact, that Mr. Lincoln seldom communicated
to anyone his views on this subject. But, be this as it
may, I have no hesitation whatever in saying, that, whilst he
held many opinions in common with the great mass of Christian
believers, he did not believe in what are regarded as the
orthodox or evangelical views of Christianity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>"'On the innate depravity of man, the character and
office of the great Head of the Church, the atonement, the
infallibility of the written revelation, the performance of
miracles, the nature and design of present and future rewards
and punishments (as they are probably called), and many other
subjects, he held opinions utterly at variance with what are
usually taught in the church. I should say that his expressed
views on these and kindred topics were such as, in the estimation
of most believers, would place him entirely outside the
Christian pale. Yet, to my mind, such was not the true position,
since his principles and practices and the spirit of his
whole life were of the very kind we universally agree to call
Christian; and I think this conclusion is in no wise affected
by the circumstance that he never attached himself to any
religious society whatever.</p>

<p>"'His religious views were eminently practical, and are
summed up, as I think, in these two propositions: "the Fatherhood
of God, and the brotherhood of man." He fully believed
in a superintending and overruling Providence, that guides and
controls the operations of the world, but maintained that law
and order, and not the violation or suspension, are the appointed
means by which this providence is expressed.</p>

<p>"'I will not attempt any specification of either his belief or
disbelief on various religious topics, as derived from conversations
with him at different times during a considerable period;
but, as conveying a general view of his religious or theological
opinions, will state the following facts. Some eight or ten
years prior to his death, in conversing with him upon this
subject, the writer took occasion to refer, in terms of approbation,
to the sermons and writings generally of Dr. W. E.
Channing; and, finding he was considerably interested in the
statement I made of the opinions held by that author, I proposed
to present him [Lincoln] a copy of Channing's entire
works, which I soon after did. Subsequently, the contents of
these volumes, together with the writings of Theodore Parker,
furnished him, as he informed me, by his friend and law partner,
Mr. Herndon, became naturally the topics of conversation
with us; and though far from believing there was an entire
harmony of views on his part with either of those authors, yet
they were generally much admired and approved by him.</p>

<p>"'No religious views with him seemed to find any favor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
except of the practical and rationalistic order; and if, from
my recollections on this subject, I was called upon to designate
an author whose views most nearly represented Mr. Lincoln's
on this subject, I would say that author was Theodore Parker.</p>

<p>"'As you have asked from me a candid statement of my
recollections on this topic, I have thus briefly given them,
with the hope that they may be of some service in rightly
settling a question about which&mdash;as I have good reason to believe&mdash;the
public mind has been greatly misled.</p>

<p>"'Not doubting that they will accord, substantially, with
your own recollections, and that of his other intimate and
confidential friends, and with the popular verdict after this
matter shall have been properly canvassed, I submit them.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>:
<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, pp. 490, 491, 492.</p></blockquote>

<p>Herndon was attempting to collect evidence that Lincoln
was an infidel, and what he obtained, and what essentially he
was called to certify and did certify in effect, was that Lincoln's
views were in essential accord with those of Theodore Parker
and William Ellery Channing. Theodore Parker was not an
orthodox Christian according to the standards of Dr. Smith's
church, or of the church of which the present writer is pastor,
but he was a Christian, and a very brave and noble Christian.
William Ellery Channing's views were not in full accord with
the orthodoxy of his day, but he was a noble friend of God
and man, and a true Christian.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the very loose and inexact way
in which Herndon and others use the term "infidel" as applied
to Lincoln. Such inexactness is subversive of all clear
thinking.</p>

<p>We are told, for instance, that he was an infidel, his views
being essentially those of Theodore Parker and William Ellery
Channing. I doubt if he ever read very deeply in the writings
of these men; but that he read portions of them and approved
of some of their noblest and most characteristic utterances, is
certain. What were the discourses of these two men which
he must almost certainly have read if he read anything of
theirs? He would almost certainly have read Parker's discourse
on "The Transient and Permanent in Christianity,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and that on "Immortal Life," and Channing's Baltimore address
and his discourse on the Church. And these are just the
sort of utterances which he would have read with approval
as he found them in these discourses of Theodore Parker:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Compare the simpleness of Christianity, as Christ sets it
forth on the Mount, with what is sometimes taught and accepted
in that honored name, and what a difference! One is
of God, one is of man. There is something in Christianity
which sects have not reached,&mdash;something that will not be
won, we fear, by theological battles, or the quarrels of pious
men; still we may rejoice that Christ is preached in any way.
The Christianity of sects, of the pulpit, of society, is ephemeral,&mdash;a
transitory fly. It will pass off and be forgot. Some
new form will take its place, suited to the aspect of the changing
times. Each will represent something of truth, but no one
the whole. It seems the whole race of man is needed to do
justice to the whole of truth, as 'the whole church to preach
the whole gospel.' Truth is intrusted for the time to a perishable
ark of human contrivance. Though often shipwrecked,
she always comes safe to land, and is not changed by her mishap.
That pure ideal religion which Jesus saw on the mount
of his vision, and lived out in the lowly life of a Galilean
peasant; which transforms his cross into an emblem of all
that is holiest on earth; which makes sacred the ground he
trod, and is dearest to the best of men, most true to what is
truest in them,&mdash;cannot pass away. Let men improve never so
far in civilization, or soar never so high on the wings of religion
and love, they can never outgo the flight of truth and
Christianity. It will always be above them. It is as if we
were to fly towards a star, which becomes larger and more
bright the nearer we approach, till we enter and are absorbed
in its glory."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Theodore Parker</span>: <i>The Transient and Permanent
in Christianity</i>, p. 31.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I would not slight this wondrous world. I love its day
and night: its flowers and its fruits are dear to me. I would
not willfully lose sight of a departing cloud. Every year opens
new beauty in a star, or in a purple gentian fringed with loveliness.
The laws, too, of matter seem more wonderful, the
more I study them, in the whirling eddies of the dust, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
curious shells of former life buried by thousands in a grain
of chalk, or in the shining diagrams of light above my head.
Even the ugly becomes beautiful when truly seen. I see the
jewel in the bunchy toad. The more I live, the more I love
this lovely world,&mdash;feel more its Author in each little thing, in
all that is great. But yet I feel my immortality the more. In
childhood the consciousness of immortal life buds forth feeble,
though full of promise. In the man it unfolds its fragrant
petals, his most celestial flower, to mature its seed throughout
eternity. The prospect of that everlasting life, the perfect
justice yet to come, the infinite progress before us, cheer
and comfort the heart. Sad and disappointed, full of self-reproach,
we shall not be so forever. The light of heaven
breaks upon the night of trial, sorrow, sin: the somber clouds
which overhung the east, grown purple now, tell us the dawn
of heaven is coming in. Our faces, gleamed on by that, smile
in the new-born glow. We are beguiled of our sadness before
we are aware. The certainty of this provokes us to patience,
it forbids us to be slothfully sorrowful. It calls us to be up
and doing. The thought that all will at last be right with
the slave, the poor, the weak, and the wicked, inspires us with
zeal to work for them here, and make it all right for them
even now."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Theodore Parker</span>: <i>Immortality</i>, pp. 23-24.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is affirmed that Lincoln was an infidel, believing essentially
the same as Theodore Parker: and he himself expressed
such admiration for and accord with the utterances of Parker
which he knew that the statement is partly true. These two
quotations, from two of the most easily accessible of Parker's
discourses, represent the kind of teaching which Lincoln assimilated
from Theodore Parker and show us what kind of
infidelity Lincoln learned from him.</p>

<p>When Lincoln turned to the most widely circulated of
Channing's discourses, he read such utterances as these:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We regard the Scriptures as the records of God's successive
revelations to mankind, and particularly of the last and
most perfect revelation of His will by Jesus Christ. Whatever
doctrines seem to us to be clearly taught in the Scriptures, we
receive without reserve or exception. We do not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
attach equal importance to all the books in this collection.</p>

<p>"Our leading principle in interpreting Scripture is this,
that the Bible is a book written for men, in the language of
men, and that its meaning is to be sought in the same manner
as that of other books. We believe that God, when He speaks
to the human race, conforms, if we may so say, to the established
rules of speaking and writing. How else would the
Scriptures avail us more than if communicated in an unknown
tongue?</p>

<p>"If God be infinitely wise, He cannot sport with the understandings
of His creatures. A wise teacher discovers his wisdom
in adapting himself to the capacities of his pupils, not
in perplexing them with what is unintelligible, not in distressing
them with apparent contradictions, not in filling them with
a skeptical distrust of their own powers. An infinitely wise
teacher, who knows the precise extent of our minds, and the
best method of enlightening them, will surpass all other instructors
in bringing down truth to our apprehension, and in
showing its loveliness and harmony. We ought, indeed, to
expect occasional obscurity in such a book as the Bible, which
was written for past and future ages, as well as for the present.
But God's wisdom is a pledge, that whatever is necessary for
<i>us</i>, and necessary for salvation, is revealed too plainly to be
mistaken, and too consistently to be questioned, by a sound
and upright mind. It is not the mark of wisdom to use an
unintelligible phraseology, to communicate what is above our
capacities, to confuse and unsettle the intellect by appearances
of contradiction. We honor our heavenly teacher too much
to ascribe to Him such a revelation. A revelation is a gift of
light. It cannot thicken our darkness, and multiply our perplexities.</p>

<p>"We believe, too, that God is just; but we never forget
that His justice is the justice of a good being, dwelling in the
same mind, and acting in harmony with perfect benevolence.
By this attribute, we understand God's infinite regard to
virtue or moral worth, expressed in a moral government; that
is, in giving excellent and equitable laws, and in conferring
such rewards and inflicting such punishments, as are best fitted
to secure their observance. God's justice has for its end the
highest virtue of the creation, and it punishes for this end
alone, and thus it coincides with benevolence; for virtue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
happiness, though not the same, are inseparably conjoined.</p>

<p>"God's justice, thus viewed, appears to us to be in perfect
harmony with His mercy. According to the prevalent systems
of theology, these attributes are so discordant and jarring, that
to reconcile them is the hardest task, and the most wonderful
achievement, of infinite wisdom. To us they seem to be
intimate friends, always at peace, breathing the same spirit,
and seeking the same end. By God's mercy, we understand
not a blind, instinctive compassion, which forgives without reflection,
and without regard to the interests of virtue. This,
we acknowledge, would be incompatible with justice, and also
with enlightened benevolence. God's mercy, as we understand
it, desires strongly the happiness of the guilty, but only through
their penitence."&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. E. Channing</span>: Baltimore Discourse of
1819, <i>Passim</i>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"Inward sanctity, pure love, disinterested attachment to
God and man, obedience of heart and life, sincere excellence of
character, this is the one thing needful, this the essential thing
in religion; and all things else, ministers, churches, ordinances,
places of worship, all are but means, helps, secondary influences,
and utterly worthless when separated from this. To
imagine that God regards any thing but this, that He looks at
any thing but the heart, is to dishonor Him, to express a
mournful insensibility to His pure character. Goodness, purity,
virtue, this is the only distinction in God's sight. This is
intrinsically, essentially, everlastingly, and by its own nature,
lovely, beautiful, glorious, divine. It owes nothing to time, to
circumstance to outward connections. It shines by its own
light. It is the sun of the spiritual universe. It is God himself
dwelling in the human soul. Can any man think lightly of it,
because it has not grown up in a certain church, or exalt any
church above it? My friends, one of the grandest truths of
religion is the supreme importance of character, of virtue, of
that divine spirit which shone out in Christ. The grand heresy
is, to substitute any thing for this, whether creed, or form, or
church."&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. E. Channing</span>: <i>Discourse on the Church</i>,
pp. 23-24.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Lincoln was made an infidel or confirmed in his infidelity
by his reading of William Ellery Channing, the foregoing is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
reasonable sample of the quality of his infidelity: for these are
not only characteristic utterances of Channing: they are among
the utterances which Lincoln was most certain to have had
thrust into his hand, and most likely to have read and to have
approved.</p>

<p>The author of this work is not a Unitarian, and he is
ready, on any proper occasion, to define to anyone who has a
right to know, his own opinions in contradistinction from those
of the Unitarian churches. But his loyalty to his own convictions
lays upon him no obligation to be unfair to men who hold
opinions other than his own. It is to be noted that it is Mr.
Herndon, and not some bigoted exponent of orthodoxy, who
calls Theodore Parker an infidel. The present writer holds no
such opinion of Parker, nor yet of Channing. On the contrary,
he is of opinion that their writings were beneficial to
Abraham Lincoln, as helping him to define some of his own
views constructively and reverently. While Beecher or Bushnell
might have done it as well or better, it was not their books
which Jesse Fell gave to Lincoln; and Lincoln used what he
had. To say that Lincoln's views were like those of Parker
or Channing is to affirm that Lincoln was not an infidel, but a
Christian.</p>

<p>Was Lincoln, then, a Unitarian?</p>

<p>No. Of Unitarianism he knew nothing, so far as we are
informed. He knew the views of certain Unitarians, and these
assisted him at important points in defining certain aspects of
his faith.</p>

<p>There have been rumors that Mr. Lincoln did come into
actual contact with organized Unitarianism. I have been interested
in inquiring whether this was true. During the Billy
Sunday meetings in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1916, the Unitarians
opened a booth there for the distribution of their literature,
and there were certain communications in the local press
resulting from the counter-irritation of those meetings.
Among these was one in the Paterson <i>Guardian</i>, signed
"Once-in-Awhile." It said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"The following is, in part, a sketch of my own youthful
experience, together with a statement of facts that relate to
others who long since have passed on.</p>

<p>"In 1851-52 the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad was being built,
and I was employed on a section of the work at that time.
Our section extended from Springfield, Illinois, to a little town
called Chatham, situated near the Sangamon River, a distance
of about ten miles south from Springfield. The majority of
the people who had located in that part of the country at that
time were from the central part of New York State, and
among them was Elder Shipman, a Unitarian. He was a very
able preacher and 'made good' with all who knew him in the
Sangamon country. It was not long before he received a call
to preach in Springfield. The little Unitarian church there was
located just around the corner from Capitol Square. When
Elder Shipman was permanently located there, Abraham Lincoln
became a regular and seemingly much interested attendant.
Nearly all of the boys in our 'gang' had known Elder Shipman
way back in New York State, and, there being no ball
games or other amusements save an occasional horse race,
almost every Sunday all hands would saddle horses and gallop
to Springfield to attend the services conducted there by our
old-time pastor. At the close of the regular service Mr. Lincoln
was often called upon for a few remarks, and many of
his sayings are still fresh in my mind today, although that was
sixty-three years ago. Since then, in the quiet hours that have
passed, I often find myself looking back through the mist of
vanished years and fancy I feel the grip of his great, bony
hand in mine, or rather mine in his, and hear his kindly voice
saying, 'Boys, good-by, come again. Come often!'</p>

<p>"I am not saying that Mr. Lincoln subscribed to the Unitarian
articles of faith, but I have good and sufficient reason
to believe that he did, and, if I am not mistaken, the proof is
wanting that he ever subscribed to faith in articles of any
other religious denomination."</p></blockquote>

<p>I challenged the veracity of this letter, reprinting it in <i>The
Advance</i>, of which I was editor, and asking these questions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Who is Mr. Once-in-Awhile, and why does he not sign
his real name?</p>

<p>2. How does it happen that no one else of those who at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>tended
the alleged Unitarian church in Springfield in the days
when Lincoln is supposed to have been there has risen up to
tell this story some time during the last half century; and why
does it come to us from Paterson and not from Springfield?</p>

<p>3. Who is this Elder Shipman concerning whom this letter
tells us? We are informed that the Unitarian Year Book
shows no such man.</p>

<p>4. Where was this Unitarian church "just around the
corner from Capitol Square"? Around which corner, and
what became of it?</p>

<p>We are informed that there was no Unitarian church in
Springfield sixty-three years ago. We were not there and do
not know: but if one was there, where was it? When was it
organized? Who were its ministers?</p>

<p>5. With so popular a preacher as Mr. Shipman appears to
have been, is it altogether likely that he would have made the
habit of calling upon a layman who attended his church to
speak at the close of the service?</p>

<p>6. If Mr. Lincoln was in the habit of attending this Unitarian
church, how did the Presbyterian church of Springfield
get the impression that Mr. Lincoln attended there with his
wife, and why did he continue to attend the Presbyterian
church after he went to Washington?</p>

<p>7. Lincoln is known to have said that if he knew any
church whose only creed was the command of Jesus to love
God with all one's heart and his neighbor as himself, he would
join that church, and Unitarians have frequently declared that
if Mr. Lincoln had ever come into contact with the Unitarian
Church he must on the basis of that declaration have united
with it. We are not clear if their inference is correct, but we
are clear that there has been a very general impression among
Unitarians that he was not familiar with that church and
creed.</p>

<p>We do not call in question the veracity of Mr. Once-in-Awhile,
whoever he may be. We merely do what we have
done before, we ask for one or two facts. If anybody knows
that Abraham Lincoln habitually attended a Unitarian church
and frequently participated in its public service by speaking
at the close of the sermon, let him now speak or else forever
hold his peace.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody held his peace, including Mr. Once-in-Awhile!</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Such stories are rarely made out of whole cloth. I therefore
inquired of the <i>Christian Register</i> (Unitarian) and the
<i>Christian Leader</i> (Universalist) to learn if they knew any
basis of truth in the above statement, and they did not know
and were not able to learn anything accurate about it. However,
there came to me in the course of the inquiry, which was
of necessity not very thorough for lack of anything definite
to begin with, an impression, based on information too vague
to be cited, that there was a Mr. Shipman, a Universalist
rather than a Unitarian, whose occasional services in Springfield
Mr. Lincoln attended once or more and enjoyed. But
this came to me very vaguely, and may be far from the truth.</p>

<p>Whether there be a ten per cent. modicum of fact at the
root of the above letter I will not attempt to guess, for my own
information is too meager. The picture, as a whole, of Mr.
Lincoln preaching Unitarianism from a Unitarian pulpit, and
at the close assuming charge of the service of farewell and
exhorting the railroad hands to come again is too far from
the possible truth to require very close analysis.</p>

<p>The Unitarian books which Mr. Lincoln read cursorily,
the books by Parker and Channing, must have assisted him in
this, that they gave assurance that there were forward-looking
men who believed in God and in human freedom as he did,
and who were quite as far from holding the teaching which
he had been taught to call orthodox as he was, yet who were
not infidels, but counted themselves friends of God and disciples
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Herndon asserts that Lincoln habitually spoke in his presence
in terms of denial of the supernatural birth of Jesus. On
this point I have seen but one bit of documentary evidence, and
that of unique interest, in two words written in a book that
once belonged to Lincoln. The book is entitled <i>Exercises in
the Syntax of the Greek Language</i>, by Rev. William Nielson,
D.D., and contains two appendixes by Prof. Charles Anthon,
noted as a Greek scholar and the author of a Greek Grammar
and other textbooks. It was published by T. &amp; J. Swords in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
New York, in 1825. At the bottom of page 34 is a sentence,
shortened and modified from John 16:27, and printed in
parallel Greek and English,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye have loved me, and</span><br />
<span class="i0">have believed that I came forth</span><br />
<span class="i0">from God."</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The words "from God" are erased with pen, and the
words, "from nature" substituted, apparently in the handwriting
of Mr. Lincoln. This, if its genuineness be established,
would appear to be conclusive that at the time Lincoln owned
this book he denied the supernatural birth of Jesus.</p>

<p>The book was formerly a part of the noted collection of
Mr. John E. Burton, procured by him from the collection of
Dr. J. B. English, and was retained by Mr. Burton with other
unique items when his large collection was broken up some
years ago. I was privileged to examine the book by A. C.
McClurg &amp; Co., in April, 1919; the book being then and
possibly still owned by them.</p>

<p>That the book was once owned by Lincoln would appear
certain. His signature on the flyleaf is in his firm, mature
hand, written as he was accustomed to write it until some
time after he became President, "A. Lincoln." The ownership
would appear to be still further attested by an inscription
on the inside of the front cover, "Compliments to Master
Abe Lincoln, and good success, truly yours, Charles Anthon,
Columbia College." But this inscription raises more questions
than it answers. I am not familiar with the handwriting of
Professor Anthon, but I am disposed to question the genuineness
of this inscription. That it has been received as genuine
by previous owners of the book is attested by the fact that
another hand has written before "Columbia College" the
words "A Prof." evidently that Professor Anthon might be
properly introduced to persons who did not know him. Professor
Anthon was a noted classical scholar, but I cannot help
wondering at what period of his career he could have come
into personal touch with Abraham Lincoln. Not, certainly, in
1825, when the book was published, and when Lincoln was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
sixteen years old. And at what later period would Professor
Anthon have addressed him as "Master Abe Lincoln"?</p>

<p>If Anthon came to know Lincoln personally so as to care
to present him with one of his books, it would seem as if he
would have given him a book of which he was the sole or chief
author, and not one in which his part was confined to the
appendix. Anthon's interest in the Greek was primarily classical,
and that of the author of this work was primarily Biblical.
If Anthon came to know Lincoln it would probably have been
after Lincoln had become a national figure, say in 1848 or
some later year, by which time a book issued in 1825 would
have become an old story to an author engaged in publishing
new books.</p>

<p>Let me, then, in the absence of direct evidence, venture the
hypothesis that the book was really owned by Lincoln; that it
came into his possession not earlier than the time when, having
mastered Kirkham's Grammar, he welcomed the ownership
of a book which suggested the possible knowledge of a classical
tongue. That he bought the book is hardly probable; that
it was the gift of Professor Anthon is improbable, because
there would appear to have been no contact between the two at
a period when such a gift would have been appropriate: let us
assume, then, that someone else gave him the book, and that
the attribution to Professor Anthon is the conjectural record
of a later owner.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The book might conceivably have come into Lincoln's possession
through the Green boys, or the brother of Ann Rutledge,
returning from Illinois College to New Salem; for it
was a book which might easily have been floating around Jacksonville,
and picked up by a student there, and later discarded
because he had no special interest in the Greek of the New Testament.
Lincoln would have been more likely to feel a passing
interest in it then than at any other period of his career,
for he was widening his educational horizon, and had not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
yet set any limits to his learning in one or another direction.
He might have picked it up, or it might have been handed him
by some minister, during his early years in Springfield; but
by that time Lincoln must have given up any passing notion
that he might ever learn Greek. He could hardly have procured
it and would not have cared for it before he lived in
New Salem: he must have ceased to think of the possibility of
learning Greek before he had lived long in Springfield.</p>

<p>I assume, also, that the erasure of the words "from God"
and the substitution of the words "from nature" is in Lincoln's
hand; though the two words are written at the very
bottom of the page, with no support for the hand, and are
not as well written as the signature, and their authenticity
might be questioned. I am disposed to think that he wrote
it, and this, evidently, was the opinion of Mr. Burton, as indicated
by a note in the book in his handwriting.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned in passing that the word "God" is
not in this verse in the New Testament, either Greek or English.
It reads, "Ye have loved me, and have believed that I
came forth from the Father." Perhaps if Dr. Nielson had
followed the text literally, Lincoln would not have troubled to
amend it.</p>

<p>I accept it as a genuine document, and one of real interest;
but the lack of a date makes it almost valueless as proof of
Lincoln's settled belief. I place it, conjecturally, in the New
Salem period of his life, though it may date from the beginning
of his life in Springfield.</p>

<p>I have not read the entire book, nor compared the Greek
throughout with the English, but I note that in this passage
the English is not translated from the Greek, but the Greek is
translated backward from the English, and that inexactly.
I judge this to be not the effect of bad scholarship but the
result of a desire to convey a lesson. For instance, the Greek
of this passage is made into a personal confession by the
change of person in the first part of the verse, without corresponding
change in the second part, leaving the first verb
without a direct object, so that a literal translation reads,&mdash;</p>


<p class="c">
"I love and believe that I came forth from God."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Nielson probably knew why he did it so, but Professor
Anthon would have been likely to say that that was not
very good Greek syntax. It served its purpose, however, as
showing, what this section was intended to show, the various
uses of the Greek conjunctions.</p>

<p>Lincoln, it may be presumed, got little if anything out of
the Greek. I find no mark of his except on this and the facing
page. There he found two admonitions which he boxed in,
and made a note of them on the false-title:</p>


<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">4. Deliberate slowly, but execute</span><br />
<span class="i0">promptly, the things which</span><br />
<span class="i0">have appeared unto thee proper</span><br />
<span class="i0">to be done.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">5. Love, not the immoderate</span><br />
<span class="i0">acquisition, but the moderate enjoyment,</span><br />
<span class="i0">of present good.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the front of the book he wrote a reference to this, and
added,</p>

<p class="c">
Deliberate slowly but<br />
execute promptly.<br />
Think well and do your duty.<br />
</p>

<p>These precepts seemed to impress him; and they were certainly
characteristic of him. But we can draw no very wide
deduction from his use of the Greek or the substitution of the
word in the translation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>

<p class="c">CHITTENDEN AND CHINIQUY</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> notable interviews touching the religious opinions of Mr.
Lincoln deserve record here. One is by Rev. Charles Chiniquy,
some time priest in the Roman Catholic Church, and afterward
a strong Protestant. He had been a client of Mr. Lincoln's
in Illinois, and Mr. Lincoln trusted and believed in him. He
visited Mr. Lincoln in the White House, and there, as before
Mr. Lincoln's departure for Springfield, he warned him that
there were plots against the life of the President.</p>

<p>The other is by Hon. L. E. Chittenden, who was chosen by
Mr. Lincoln as Register of the Treasury, and who was an
honest and incorruptible man.</p>

<p>Father Chiniquy visited Mr. Lincoln in the White House
in August, 1861, June, 1862, and June, 1864, for the purpose
of warning Mr. Lincoln of plots, which Father Chiniquy believed
to be inspired by Jesuits, against the life of Mr. Lincoln.
On the last of these occasions, June 9, 1864, in the course of
an extended interview, he reported Mr. Lincoln as saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'You are not the first to warn me against the dangers of
assassination. My ambassadors in Italy, France, and England,
as well as Professor Morse, have, many times, warned me
against the plots of murderers whom they have detected in
those different countries. But I see no other safeguard against
these murderers, but to be always ready to die, as Christ advises
it. As we must all die sooner or later, it makes very little
difference to me whether I die from a dagger plunged through
the heart or from an inflammation of the lungs. Let me tell
you that I have, lately, read a message in the Old Testament
which has made a profound, and, I hope, a salutary impression
on me. Here is that passage.'</p>

<p>"The President took his Bible, opened it at the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
chapter of Deuteronomy, and read from the 22d to the 27th
verse:</p>

<p>"'"22. Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God
he shall fight for you.</p>

<p>"'"23. And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,</p>

<p>"'"24. O Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant
thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in
heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and
according to thy might?</p>

<p>"'"25. I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land
that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"'"26. But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes,
and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it
suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</p>

<p>"'"27. Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up
thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward,
and behold it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over
this Jordan."'</p>

<p>"After the President had read these words with great
solemnity, he added:</p>

<p>"'My dear Father Chiniquy, let me tell you that I have
read these strange and beautiful words several times, these last
five or six weeks. The more I read them, the more it seems
to me that God has written them for me as well as for Moses.</p>

<p>"'Has He not taken me from my poor log cabin, by the
hand, as He did Moses, in the reeds of the Nile, to put me
at the head of the greatest and most blessed of modern nations
just as He put that prophet at the head of the most blessed
nation of ancient times? Has not God granted me a privilege,
which was not granted to any living man, when I broke
the fetters of 4,000,000 of men, and made them free? Has
not our God given me the most glorious victories over my
enemies? Are not the armies of the Confederacy so reduced
to a handful of men, when compared to what they were two
years ago, that the day is fast approaching when they will
have to surrender?</p>

<p>"'Now, I see the end of this terrible conflict, with the same
joy of Moses, when at the end of his trying forty years in the
wilderness; and I pray my God to grant me to see the days
of peace and untold prosperity, which will follow this cruel
war, as Moses asked God to see the other side of Jordan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
enter the Promised Land. But, do you know, that I hear in
my soul, as the voice of God, giving me the rebuke which was
given to Moses?</p>

<p>"'Yes! every time that my soul goes to God to ask the
favor of seeing the other side of Jordan, and eating the fruits
of that peace, after which I am longing with such an unspeakable
desire, do you know that there is a still but solemn voice
which tells me that I will see those things only from a long
distance, and that I will be among the dead when the nation,
which God granted me to lead through those awful trials, will
cross the Jordan, and dwell in that Land of Promise, where
peace, industry, happiness, and liberty will make everyone
happy; and why so? Because He has already given me
favors which He never gave, I dare say, to any man in these
latter days.</p>

<p>"'Why did God Almighty refuse to Moses the favor of
crossing the Jordan, and entering the Promised Land? It was
on account of the nation's sins! That law of divine retribution
and justice, by which one must suffer for another, is
surely a terrible mystery. But it is a fact which no man who
has any intelligence and knowledge can deny. Moses, who
knew that law, though he probably did not understand it better
than we do, calmly says to his people: "God was wroth with
me for your sakes."</p>

<p>"'But, though we do not understand that mysterious and
terrible law, we find it written in letters of tears and blood
wherever we go. We do not read a single page of history
without finding undeniable traces of its existence.</p>

<p>"'Where is the mother who has not shed real tears and
suffered real tortures, for her children's sake?</p>

<p>"'Who is the good king, the worthy emperor, the gifted
chieftain, who has not suffered unspeakable mental agonies, or
even death, for his people's sake?</p>

<p>"'Is not our Christian religion the highest expression of
the wisdom, mercy, and love of God! But what is Christianity
if not the very incarnation of that eternal law of Divine justice
in our humanity?</p>

<p>"'When I look on Moses, alone, silently dying on the
Mount Pisgah, I see that law, in one of its most sublime human
manifestations, and I am filled with admiration and awe.</p>

<p>"'But when I consider that law of justice, and expiation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in the death of the Just, the divine Son of Mary, on the Mount
of Calvary, I remain mute in my adoration. The spectacle of
the Crucified One which is before my eyes is more than
sublime, it is divine! Moses died for his People's sake, but
Christ died for the whole world's sake! Both died to fulfill
the same eternal law of the Divine justice, though in a different
measure.</p>

<p>"'Now, would it not be the greatest of honors and privileges
bestowed upon me, if God in His infinite love, mercy,
and wisdom would put me between His faithful servant,
Moses, and His eternal Son, Jesus, that I might die as they
did, for my nation's sake!</p>

<p>"'My God alone knows what I have already suffered
for my dear country's sake. But my fear is that the justice
of God is not yet paid. When I look upon the rivers of tears
and blood drawn by the lashes of the merciless masters from
the veins of the very heart of those millions of defenseless
slaves, these two hundred years; when I remember the
agonies, the cries, the unspeakable tortures of those unfortunate
people to which I have, to some extent, connived with so
many others a part of my life, I fear that we are still far from
the complete expiation. For the judgments of God are true
and righteous.</p>

<p>"'It seems to me that the Lord wants today, as He wanted
in the days of Moses, another victim&mdash;a victim which He has
himself chosen, anointed and prepared for the sacrifice, by
raising it above the rest of His people. I cannot conceal from
you that my impression is that I am the victim. So many plots
have already been made against my life, that it is a real
miracle that they have all failed. But can we expect that
God will make a perpetual miracle to save my life? I believe
not.</p>

<p>"'But just as the Lord heard no murmur from the lips of
Moses, when He told him that he had to die before crossing
the Jordan, for the sins of his people, so I hope and pray
that He will hear no murmur from me when I fall for my
nation's sake.</p>

<p>"'The only two favors I ask of the Lord are, first, that
I may die for the sacred cause in which I am engaged, and
when I am the standard bearer of the rights and privileges of
my country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>"'The second favor I ask from God is that my dear son,
Robert, when I am gone, will be one of those who lift up that
flag of Liberty which will cover my tomb, and carry it with
honor and fidelity to the end of his life, as his father did,
surrounded by the millions who will be called with him to fight
and die for the defense and honor of our country.'</p>

<p>"'Never had I heard such sublime words,' says Father
Chiniquy. 'Never had I seen a human face so solemn and
so prophet-like as the face of the President when uttering
these things. Every sentence had come to me as a hymn from
heaven, reverberated by the echoes of the mountains of Pisgah
and Calvary. I was beside myself. Bathed in tears, I tried
to say something, but I could not utter a word. I knew the
hour to leave had come. I asked from the President permission
to fall on my knees and pray with him that his life might
be spared; and he knelt with me. But I prayed more with my
tears and sobs than with my words. Then I pressed his hand
on my lips and bathed it with tears, and with a heart filled
with an unspeakable desolation, I bade him adieu.'"&mdash;<i>Fifty
Years in the Church of Rome</i>, pp. 706-10.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hon. L. E. Chittenden, Register of the Treasury under
Lincoln, gives this testimony to Lincoln's religious character:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the Presidential campaign of 1864 there were sullen
whisperings that Mr. Lincoln had no religious opinions nor
any interest in churches or Christian institutions. They faded
away with other libels, never to be renewed until after his
death. One of his biographers, who calls himself the 'friend
and partner for twenty years' of the deceased President, has
since published what he calls a history of his life, in which
he revives the worst of these rumors, with additions which, if
true, would destroy much of the world's respect for Mr. Lincoln.
He asserts that his 'friend and partner' was 'an infidel
verging towards atheism.' Others have disseminated these
charges in lectures and fugitive sketches so industriously that
they have produced upon strangers some impression of their
truth. The excuse alleged is, their desire to present Mr. Lincoln
to the world 'just as he was.' Their real purpose is to
present him just as they would have him to be, as much as
possible like themselves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is a trait of the infidel to parade his unbelief before
the public, and he thinks something gained to himself when he
can show that others are equally deficient in moral qualities.
But these writers have attempted too much. Their principal
charge of infidelity, tinged with atheism, is so completely at
variance with all our knowledge of his opinions that its origin
must be attributed to malice or to a defective mental constitution.</p>

<p>"His sincerity and candor were conspicuous qualities of
Mr. Lincoln's mind. Deception was a vice in which he had
neither experience nor skill. All who were admitted to his
intimacy will agree that he was incapable of professing opinions
which he did not entertain. When we find him at the
moment of leaving his home for Washington, surrounded by
his neighbors of a quarter of a century, taking Washington for
his exemplar, whose success he ascribed 'to the aid of that
Divine Providence upon which he at all times relied,' and
publicly declaring that he, himself, 'placed his whole trust in
the same Almighty Being, and the prayers of Christian men
and women'; when, not once or twice, but on all proper, and
more than a score of subsequent occasions, he avowed his faith
in an Omnipotent Ruler, who will judge the world in
righteousness&mdash;in the Bible as the inspired record of His history
and His law; when with equal constancy he thanked
Almighty God for, and declared his interest in, Christian institutions
and influences as the appointed means for his effective
service, we may assert that we know that he was neither an
atheist nor an infidel, but, on the contrary, a sincere believer in
the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith. In fact, he
believed so confidently that the Almighty was making use of
the war, of himself, and other instrumentalities in working out
some great design for the benefit of humanity, and his belief
that he himself was directed by the same Omniscient Power
was expressed with such frankness and frequency, that it
attracted attention, and was criticized by some as verging
towards superstition. His public life was a continuous service
of God and his fellow-man, controlled and guided by the
golden rule, in which there was no hiatus of unbelief or
incredulity.</p>

<p>"Here I might well stop, and submit that these charges do
not deserve any further consideration. But I know how false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
they are, and I may be excused if I record one of my sources
of knowledge.</p>

<p>"The emphatic statement made by the President to Mr.
Fessenden, that he was called to the Presidency by a Power
higher than human authority, I have already mentioned. His
calm serenity at times when others were so anxious, his confidence
that his own judgment was directed by the Almighty,
so impressed me that, when I next had the opportunity, at
some risk of giving offense, I ventured to ask him directly
how far he believed the Almighty actually directed our national
affairs. There was a considerable pause before he spoke, and
when he did speak, what he said was more in the nature of a
monologue than an answer to my inquiry:</p>

<p>"'That the Almighty does make use of human agencies,
and directly intervenes in human affairs, is,' he said, 'one of
the plainest evidences of His direction, so many instances when
I have been controlled by some other power than my own will,
that I cannot doubt that this power comes from above. I frequently
see my way clear to a decision when I am conscious
that I have no sufficient facts upon which to found it. But I
cannot recall one instance in which I have followed my own
judgment, founded upon such a decision, where the results
were unsatisfactory; whereas, in almost every instance where
I have yielded to the views of others, I have had occasion
to regret it. I am satisfied that when the Almighty wants me
to do or not to do a particular thing, He finds a way of letting
me know it. I am confident that it is His design to restore the
Union. He will do it in His own good time. We should obey
and not oppose His will.'</p>

<p>"'You speak with such confidence,' I said, 'that I would
like to know how your knowledge that God acts directly upon
human affairs compares in certainty with your knowledge of a
fact apparent to the senses&mdash;for example, the fact that we are
at this moment here in this room.'</p>

<p>"'One is as certain as the other,' he answered, 'although
the conclusions are reached by different processes. I know by
my senses that the movements of the world are those of an
infinitely powerful machine, which runs for ages without a
variation. A man who can put two ideas together knows that
such a machine requires an infinitely powerful maker and
governor: man's nature is such that he cannot take in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
machine and keep out the maker. This maker is God&mdash;infinite
in wisdom as well as in power. Would we be any more certain
if we saw Him?'</p>

<p>"'I am not controverting your position,' I said. 'Your
confidence interests me beyond expression. I wish I knew how
to acquire it. Even now, must it not all depend on our faith
in the Bible?'</p>

<p>"'No. There is the element of personal experience,' he
said. 'If it did, the character of the Bible is easily established,
at least to my satisfaction. We have to believe many things
which we do not comprehend. The Bible is the only one that
claims to be God's Book&mdash;to comprise His law&mdash;His history.
It contains an immense amount of evidence of its own authenticity.
It describes a governor omnipotent enough to operate
this great machine, and declares that He made it. It states
other facts which we do not fully comprehend, but which we
cannot account for. What shall we do with them?</p>

<p>"'Now let us treat the Bible fairly. If we had a witness
on the stand whose general story we knew was true, we would
believe him when he asserted facts of which we had no other
evidence. We ought to treat the Bible with equal fairness. I
decided a long time ago that it was less difficult to believe
that the Bible was what it claimed to be than to disbelieve
it. It is a good book for us to obey&mdash;it contains the ten commandments,
the golden rule, and many other rules which ought
to be followed. No man was ever the worse for living according
to the directions of the Bible.'</p>

<p>"'If your views are correct, the Almighty is on our side,
and we ought to win without so many losses&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"He promptly interrupted me and said, 'We have no right
to criticize or complain. He is on our side, and so is the Bible,
and so are churches and Christian societies and organizations&mdash;all
of them, so far as I know, almost without an exception.
It makes me strong and more confident to know that all the
Christians in the loyal States are praying for our success, that
all their influences are working to the same end. Thousands
of them are fighting for us, and no one will say that an officer
or a private is less brave because he is a praying soldier. At
first, when we had such long spells of bad luck, I used to
lose heart sometimes. Now I seem to know that Providence
has protected and will protect us against any fatal defeat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
All we have to do is to trust the Almighty and keep right on
obeying His orders and executing His will.'</p>

<p>"I could not press inquiry further. I knew that Mr.
Lincoln was no hypocrite. There was an air of such sincerity
in his manner of speaking, and especially in his references to
the Almighty, that no one could have doubted his faith unless
the doubter believed him dishonest. It scarcely needed his
repeated statements that 'whatever shall appear to be God's
will, that will I do,' his special gratitude to God for victories,
or his numerous expressions of his firm faith that God willed
our final triumph, to convince the American people that he was
not and could not be an atheist or an infidel.</p>

<p>"He has written of the Bible, that 'this great Book of
God is the best gift which God has ever given to man,' and
that 'all things desirable for man to know are contained in
it.' His singular familiarity with its contents is even stronger
evidence of the high place it held in his judgment. His second
inaugural address shows how sensibly he appreciated the force
and beauty of its passages, and constitutes an admirable application
of its truths, only possible as the result of familiar use
and thorough study.</p>

<p>"Further comment cannot be necessary. Abraham Lincoln
accepted the Bible as the inspired word of God&mdash;he believed
and faithfully endeavored to live according to the
fundamental principles and doctrines of the Christian faith.
To doubt either proposition is to be untrue to his memory, a
disloyalty of which no American should be guilty."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chittenden</span>:
<i>Recollections of President Lincoln and His Administration</i>,
pp. 446-51.</p></blockquote>

<p>These two incidents call for no extended comment. That
in each of them the literary style is more like that of the narrator
than it is like the style of Mr. Lincoln is evident, and
there is other apparent evidence that the incidents were colored
by the imagination of the two men who related them. But
neither of them was a lie. And, when we make due deductions,
each contains a basis of fact in accord with what we
might have expected Lincoln to say.</p>

<p>For instance, the assurance which he expressed to Chittenden
that God had called him to his work as President, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
he was fulfilling divine destiny, is fully in accord with the
strong conviction of predestination which he had received in
his youth, and which was so marked that his partners took it
as a mark of selfish superiority. He did feel, and felt so
strongly that he sometimes seemed to be oblivious to other and
correlative truths, that God had called him to a great task, and
that he would live till it was accomplished, plots or no plots.
But he had a gloomy foreboding that he would not live much
longer. His conviction of predestination had in it a compelling
sense of destiny and almost of doom, a conviction of
Divinity shaping his ends, even though he rough-hewed them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE BEECHER AND SICKLES INCIDENTS</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many stories of President Lincoln's religious life,
one of the most impressive concerns an alleged visit of the
President to the home of Henry Ward Beecher and the spending
of a night in prayer by these two men. The story is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Following the disaster of Bull Run, when the strength
and resources of the nation seemed to have been wasted, the
hopes of the North were at their lowest ebb, and Mr. Lincoln
was well-nigh overwhelmed with the awful responsibility of
guiding the nation in its life struggle. Henry Ward Beecher,
of Brooklyn, was, perhaps, more prominently associated with
the cause of the North at that time than any other minister of
the gospel. He had preached and lectured and fought its
battles in pulpit and press all over the country, had ransomed
slaves from his pulpit, and his convictions and feelings were
everywhere known.</p>

<p>"Late one evening a stranger called at his home and asked
to see him. Mr. Beecher was working alone in his study, as
was his custom, and this stranger refused to send up his name,
and came muffled in a military cloak which completely hid his
face. Mrs. Beecher's suspicions were aroused, and she was
very unwilling that he should have the interview which he
requested, especially as Mr. Beecher's life had been frequently
threatened by sympathizers with the South. The latter, however,
insisted that his visitor be shown up. Accordingly, the
stranger entered, the doors were shut, and for hours the wife
below could hear their voices and their footsteps as they paced
back and forth. Finally, toward midnight, the mysterious
visitor went out, still muffled in his cloak, so that it was impossible
to gain any idea of his features.</p>

<p>"The years went by, the war was finished, the President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
had suffered martyrdom at his post, and it was not until shortly
before Mr. Beecher's death, over twenty years later, that he
made known that the mysterious stranger who had called on
that stormy night was Abraham Lincoln. The stress and
strain of those days and nights of struggle, with all the responsibilities
and sorrows of a nation fighting for its life resting
upon him, had broken his strength, and for a time undermined
his courage. He had traveled alone in disguise and at night
from Washington to Brooklyn, to gain the sympathy and help
of one whom he knew as a man of God, engaged in the same
great battle in which he was the leader. Alone for hours that
night, like Jacob of old, the two had wrestled together in
prayer with the God of battles and the Watcher over the right
until they had received the help which He had promised to
those that seek His aid."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Johnson endeavored to investigate this story for his
book, <i>Lincoln the Christian</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The evidence seemed to him sufficient
to justify him in including it in his volume. It rests on
the explicit statement of Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher and was
communicated to the public through some of her grandchildren.
This, surely, is evidence that cannot be wholly disregarded.
Mr. Samuel Scoville, Jr., a lawyer in Philadelphia,
a grandson of Henry Ward Beecher, confirmed the accuracy
of the story as here given, saying that this was the form in
which his grandmother had related the story to her grandchildren.</p>

<p>Another grandson, Rev. David G. Downey, D.D., Book
Editor of the Methodist Book Concern of New York said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has always seemed to me to be a perfectly possible
situation. It has never, however, been corroborated by any
of the members of the family. It rests entirely upon the
statement of Mrs. Beecher in her old age."&mdash;<i>Lincoln the
Christian</i>, p. 201.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher was a truthful woman. She
did not manufacture an incident of this character, but the
incident is highly improbable. It would be ungracious to point
out in detail the elements of weakness in the story.</p>

<p>Let one consideration alone be stated. The publishers of
the <i>North American Review</i> gathered from the leading men of
America a series of chapters in which each man related his
own personal reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln. That
volume is still easily obtained and is a valuable mine of information.
Among the other men who contributed to it was
Henry Ward Beecher. He wrote a chapter in which he told
in detail of his personal association with Mr. Lincoln. This
incident finds no mention there nor anything remotely resembling
it.</p>

<p>If Mr. Lincoln had felt disposed to visit Mr. Beecher for
a purpose of this character, he knew very well that the easier
and safer and far less embarrassing way was to invite Mr.
Beecher to the White House to see him. Beecher was no
stranger in Washington at this time and Lincoln had the
telegraph wires under his control and did not hesitate to use
them when there was need. Beecher made at least one journey
to Washington to confer with Lincoln on a matter of editorial
policy. His well-known sympathy with the President
was such that no explanation need have been made of his
taking a train from New York on any day and spending an
evening in Washington. A message in the morning would
have brought Beecher there by night and no one either in
Washington or New York would have thought of it as strange.
On the other hand, the absence of the President from Washington
at a time as critical as that immediately following the
Battle of Bull Run and with no one able to account for his
absence from the Capitol or with any knowledge of the errand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
that had taken him away is well-nigh preposterous. Such an
absence might have given rise to the wildest rumors of the
President's abduction or murder. Lincoln was too prudent a
man, too shrewd and cautious a man, too deeply concerned for
the possible effect of so rash and needless a journey; too
deeply chagrined over the criticisms of his alleged entering into
Washington in disguise at the time of his inauguration, to
have done the thing which Mrs. Beecher, when a very old
woman, imagined him to have done.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher was editor of <i>The Christian Union</i> and had
occasion to write about Abraham Lincoln, and he wrote nothing
of this kind. In his sermons and in his lectures he had
frequent occasion to mention Lincoln, and no story of this sort
is related as having come from him. Mr. Beecher knew too
well the homiletic and editorial value of such an incident not to
have related it if it had occurred.</p>

<p>Someone came to see him one stormy night and the two
lingered long together in prayer. For some doubtless good
reason Mr. Beecher did not tell his family the name of the
man with whom he had spent those earnest hours. Many
years afterward, Lincoln and Beecher both being dead, Mrs.
Beecher recalled the event and satisfied herself that it was Mr.
Lincoln who had come from Washington to see her husband
and spend some hours in prayer with him.</p>

<p>This is the reasonable explanation, as it seems to me, of an
incident which has had rather wide currency but which we are
not justified in accepting on the unsupported testimony of even
so good a woman as Mrs. Beecher in her old age.</p>

<p>An incident of remarkable interest, attested as authentic by
two generals of the Civil War, is related by General James
F. Rusling, in his <i>Men and Things in Civil War Days</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>General D. E. Sickles was wounded at Gettysburg, and
brought to Washington, where a leg was amputated. President
Lincoln called upon him, and in reply to a question from
General Sickles whether or not the President was anxious
about the battle at Gettysburg, Lincoln gravely said, 'No, I
was not; some of my Cabinet and many others in Washington
were, but I had no fears.' General Sickles inquired how this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
was, and seemed curious about it. Mr. Lincoln hesitated, but
finally replied: 'Well, I will tell you how it was. In the pinch
of your campaign up there, when everybody seemed panic-stricken,
and nobody could tell what was going to happen, oppressed
by the gravity of our affairs, I went to my room one
day, and I locked the door, and got down on my knees before
Almighty God, and prayed to Him mightily for victory at
Gettysburg. I told Him that this was His war, and our cause
His cause, but we couldn't stand another Fredericksburg or
Chancellorsville. And I then and there made a solemn vow
to Almighty God, that if He would stand by our boys at
Gettysburg, I would stand by Him. And He <i>did</i> stand by
you boys, and I <i>will</i> stand by Him. And after that (I don't
know how it was, and I can't explain it), soon a sweet comfort
crept into my soul that God Almighty had taken the whole
business into his own hands and that things would go all
right at Gettysburg. And that is why I had no fears about
you.' Asked concerning Vicksburg, the news of which victory
had not yet reached him, he said, 'I have been praying for
Vicksburg also, and believe our Heavenly Father is going to
give us victory there, too.' General Rusling says that Mr.
Lincoln spoke 'solemnly and pathetically, as if from the depth
of his heart,' and that his manner was deeply touching."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>

<p class="c">"BEHIND THE SCENES"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> family of the President of the United States ought to
be permitted a reasonable degree of privacy, but this has never
yet been accorded them. In the case of the family of President
Lincoln the rudeness of the public was shameful. It is not our
present purpose to intrude into the domestic life of Mr. and
Mrs. Lincoln, and if we shall ever do so hereafter it will be,
let us hope, with more of consideration than some critics have
shown.</p>

<p>After the death of Mr. Lincoln, a number of books and
articles appeared which gave close and intimate glimpses of
the life of President and Mrs. Lincoln during the four years
which they spent in the White House. We shall examine two
or three of these only in so far as they relate to Mr. Lincoln's
religious life.</p>

<p>For four years Mrs. Lincoln had with her in the White
House as dressmaker and attendant Mrs. Elizabeth Keckley,
an intelligent colored woman. In 1868 Mrs. Keckley published
a book entitled <i>Behind the Scenes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It related many
intimate details of life in the Lincoln household, with much
about Mrs. Lincoln's extravagances of expenditure and infirmities
of temper, and some things about Mr. Lincoln. It
is a most informing book, though one containing many details
which had been as well unprinted. Its general truthfulness is
attested by its internal evidence. Of Lincoln's anxiety when
battles were in progress, and of the relief which he sought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
agonized prayer, she tells, and with apparent truthfulness. Of
one battle she relates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One day he came into the room where I was fitting a
dress for Mrs. Lincoln. His step was slow and heavy, and
his face sad. Like a tired child he threw himself upon the
sofa, and shaded his eyes with his hands. He was a complete
picture of dejection. Mrs. Lincoln, observing his troubled
look, asked:</p>

<p>"'Where have you been?'</p>

<p>"'To the War Department,' was the brief, almost sullen
answer.</p>

<p>"'Any news?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, plenty of news, but no good news. It is dark,
dark everywhere.'</p>

<p>"He reached forth one of his long arms and took a small
Bible from a stand near the head of the sofa, opened the pages
of the Holy Book, and soon was absorbed in reading them.
A quarter of an hour passed, and on glancing at the sofa the
face of the President seemed more cheerful. The dejected
look was gone, and the countenance was lighted up with new
resolution and hope. The change was so marked that I could
not but wonder at it, and wonder led to the desire to know
what book of the Bible afforded so much comfort to the reader.
Making the search for a missing article an excuse, I walked
gently around the sofa, and, looking into the open book, I
discovered that Mr. Lincoln was reading that divine comforter,
Job. He read with Christian eagerness, and the courage
and the hope that he derived from the inspired pages
made him a new man."&mdash;<i>Behind the Scenes</i>, p. 118.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Keckley helped prepare the body of Willie for burial.
She relates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Willie died, as he lay on the bed, Mr. Lincoln came
to the bed, lifted the cover from the face of his child, gazed
at it long and earnestly, murmuring: 'My poor boy, he was
too good for this earth. God has called him home. I know
that he is much better off in heaven, but then we loved him
so. It is hard, hard to have him die!'"&mdash;<i>Behind the Scenes</i>,
p. 103.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. Rebecca R. Pomeroy, a Christian woman from
Chelsea, Massachusetts, who had come to nurse the Lincoln
children in their sickness, speaks of Lincoln's great affliction
and sadness. On the morning of the funeral she assured him
that many Christians were praying for him. With eyes suffused
with tears, he replied: 'I am glad to hear that. I want
them to pray for me. I need their prayers.' Mrs. Pomeroy
expressed her sympathy with him as they were going out to
the burial. Thanking her gently, he said, 'I will try to go to
God with my sorrows.' She asked him a few days after if
he could not trust God. With deep religious feeling, he replied:
'I think I can, and I will try. I wish I had that childlike
faith you speak of, and I trust He will give it to me.'
Then the memory of his mother filled his mind with tenderest
recollections, and he said: 'I had a good Christian mother,
and her prayers have followed me thus far through life.'"&mdash;<i>Lincoln
Scrapbook</i>, Library of Congress, p. 54.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Pomeroy was a Baptist, and had recently buried her
husband. She volunteered for service as a nurse in the soldiers'
hospitals in Washington, and in the serious illness of
Mr. Lincoln's two sons she was installed as nurse in the White
House and remained these several months.</p>

<p>She relates that she frequently saw him reading his
mother's Bible, and that he found especial comfort in the
Psalms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pomeroy relates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On July 9, 1863, while sitting at the dinner table he could
not eat, for he seemed so full of trouble as he said, 'The battle
of Port Hudson is now going on, and many lives will be
sacrificed on both sides, but I have done the best I could, trusting
in God, for if they gain this important point, we are lost;
and, on the other hand, if we could only gain it we shall have
gained much; and I think we shall, for we have a great deal
to thank God for, for we have Vicksburg and Gettysburg
already.' Mrs. Pomeroy said, 'Mr. Lincoln, prayer will do
what nothing else will; can you not pray?' 'Yes, I will,'
he replied, and while the tears were dropping from his face
he said, 'Pray for me,' and picked up a Bible and went to
his room. 'Could all the people of the nation have overheard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the earnest petition that went up from that inner chamber as
it reached the ears of the nurse, they would have fallen upon
their knees with tearful and reverential sympathy.' That
night he received a dispatch announcing a Union victory. He
went directly to Mrs. Pomeroy's room, his face beaming with
joy, saying: 'Good news! Good news! Port Hudson is
ours! The victory is ours, and God is good.' When the lady
replied, 'Nothing like prayer in times of trouble,' Mr. Lincoln
said, 'Yes, O yes&mdash;praise&mdash;prayer and praise go together.'
Mrs. Pomeroy in relating this incident, said, 'I do believe he
was a true Christian, though he had very little confidence in
himself.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Most valuable, and also most familiar, of these intimate
glimpses into the life of Mr. Lincoln during his years in the
White House is the book of Frank B. Carpenter called, <i>Six
Months in the White House: The Inner Life of Abraham
Lincoln</i>. The book was the work of the artist who painted
the large picture of the Signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.
For six months in 1864 he lived in the White
House where a room was fitted up for his use, and Mr. Lincoln
and all the members of the Cabinet sat to him repeatedly. It
is hardly necessary to quote this book, which is widely scattered,
and everywhere available. It is enough to remind ourselves
that the picture it gives us of Mr. Lincoln in those
solemn days after the war had settled down to a clear issue
of slavery or freedom, and had become in the mind of the
nation and the world not a political but a moral issue, is one
of dignity and heroism and of definite Christian character.</p>

<p>An incident following the death of Willie has been related
on the alleged authority of Rev. Francis Vinton, rector of
Trinity Church, New York, who was an acquaintance of Mrs.
Lincoln and visited Washington and called at the White House
soon after that sad event. As reported, he said to Mr.
Lincoln:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Your son is alive.'</p>

<p>"'Alive!' exclaimed Mr. Lincoln. 'Surely you mock me.'</p>

<p>"'No, sir; believe me,' replied Dr. Vinton; 'it is a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
comforting doctrine of the Church, founded upon the words
of Christ Himself.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln threw his arm around Dr. Vinton's neck,
laid his head upon his breast, and sobbed aloud, '<i>Alive?
Alive?</i>'</p>

<p>"Dr. Vinton, greatly moved, said: 'My dear sir, believe
this, for it is God's most precious truth. Seek not your son
among the dead; he is not there; he lives today in paradise!
Think of the full import of the words I have quoted. The
Sadducees, when they questioned Jesus, had no other conception
than that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were dead and
buried. Mark the reply: "Now that the dead <i>are</i> raised, even
Moses showed at the bush when he called the Lord the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He
is not the God of the dead, but of the living, <i>for all live unto
Him</i>!" Did not the great patriarch mourn his sons as dead?
"Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin,
also!" But Joseph and Simeon were both living, though he
believed it not. Indeed, Joseph being taken from him was
the eventual means of the preservation of the whole family.
And so God has called your son into His upper kingdom&mdash;a
kingdom and an existence as real, more real, than your own.
It may be that he too, like Joseph, has gone, in God's good
providence, to be the salvation of <i>his</i> father's household. It is
a part of the Lord's plan for the ultimate happiness of you
and yours. Doubt it not.'</p>

<p>"Dr. Vinton [so the narrative proceeds] told Lincoln
that he had a sermon upon the subject. Mr. Lincoln asked
him to send it to him as early as possible, and thanked him
repeatedly for his cheering and hopeful words. When Lincoln
received the sermon he read it over and over, and had
a copy made for his own private use. A member of the
family said that Mr. Lincoln's views in relation to spiritual
things seemed changed from that hour."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carpenter</span>, pp.
117-19.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such an incident cannot be wholly false; nor is it quite
conceivable that it is wholly true. That Lincoln talked with
Dr. Vinton concerning his recent sorrow, and was comforted
by his assurance of immortality is not improbable, nor that he
accepted Dr. Vinton's sermon and had it copied; but the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as finally described for the public has every appearance of
being much colored.</p>

<p>In 1883 Captain Oldroyd published a collection of Lincoln
anecdotes which had long been making, most of them good
and many of them excellent, but some of them resting on
very dubitable authority. Among those of this class was
one that has been widely quoted, perhaps most widely of any
in his book:<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Shortly before his death an Illinois clergyman asked
Lincoln, 'Do you love Jesus?' Mr. Lincoln solemnly replied:
'When I left Springfield I asked the people to pray for me.
I was not a Christian. When I buried my son, the severest
trial of my life, I was not a Christian. But when I went to
Gettysburg and saw the graves of thousands of our soldiers,
I then and there consecrated myself to Christ. Yes, I <i>do</i>
love Jesus.'</p>

<p>"Reticent as he was, and shy of discoursing much of his
own mental exercises, these few utterances now have a value
with those who knew him which his dying words scarcely
have possessed."&mdash;<i>Lincoln Memorial Album</i>, p. 105.</p></blockquote>

<p>Where Captain Oldroyd obtained this incident is now
not known; probably it came to him as a newspaper clipping.
It bears no marks that commend it to our confidence. We are
not informed who this Illinois clergyman was; there may not
have been any such clergyman. If there was,&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln made many references to God, but very few
to Jesus, and then not by name, but by some title, as "the
Saviour of the World." The word "love" was one which
he almost never used. That he should have said to a man
unnamed "I do love Jesus" is highly improbable; and the
account of his conversation as given here is not probable. We
gain nothing by reliance on such unsupported allegations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>

<p class="c">FROM THE HOUSETOPS AND IN THE CLOSET</p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> part of our inquiry draws near its close. We have
reserved for this chapter a selection from those religious
expressions of Abraham Lincoln which belong to his mature
years, and which are indisputably his. They are largely in
addresses, proclamations, and official documents. In them
religion is, as a rule, an incidental subject. But it finds frequent
expression.</p>

<p>Here no literary criticism is necessary, for there is no
question about the accuracy of the report. We shall quote
nothing that is not contained in an accredited compilation of
Lincoln's papers or addresses, omitting all that is disputable
or open to the suspicion of glossation or coloring or exaggeration.</p>

<p>There is only one question, Was Abraham Lincoln sincere
in these utterances? Did he speak them as his own profound
convictions, or because he was expected to say something
of this sort, and took refuge in pious commonplaces? Both
statements have been made concerning these and like utterances.
Let us read them with an open mind and discover
what evidence they bear of their own sincerity.</p>

<p>These are not reports of private conversations, or utterances
addressed to small groups. These are the words which
Lincoln uttered in the ears of all men; and they afford some
evidence of the faith that was in him.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>In Lincoln's first annual Thanksgiving Day Proclamation,
dated October 3, 1863, after reciting the blessings of God to
the nation in the harvest and in the success of our arms, he
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal
hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious
gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in
anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.</p>

<p>"It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be
solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one
heart and one voice by the American people. I do, therefore,
invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States,
and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning
in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday
of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our
beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I
recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions
justly due Him for such singular deliverances and blessings,
they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness
and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those
who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in
the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably
engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the
Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to
restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes,
to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity,
and union."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the summer of 1864, a resolution was adopted concurrently
by the Senate and House of Representatives, requesting
the President to appoint a day of prayer, Mr. Lincoln
issued the following proclamation, July 7, 1864, in which,
after quoting the words of the resolution, he continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, cordially concurring with the Congress of the
United States in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed
in the aforesaid resolutions, and heartily approving of the
devotional design and purpose thereof, do hereby appoint the
first Thursday of August next to be observed by the people
of the United States as a day of national humiliation and
prayer.</p>

<p>"I do hereby further invite and request the heads of
the executive departments of this government, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
all legislators, all judges and magistrates, and all other persons
exercising authority in the land, whether civil, military, or
naval, and all soldiers, seamen, and marines in the national
service and all the other loyal and law-abiding people of the
United States, to assemble in their preferred places of public
worship on that day, and there and then to render to the
Almighty and merciful Ruler of the Universe such homages
and such confessions, and to offer to Him such supplications,
as the Congress of the United States have, in their aforesaid
resolution, so solemnly, so earnestly, and so reverently
recommended."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln issued another special thanksgiving proclamation
on May 9, 1864, saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Enough is known of army operations within the last
five days to claim an especial gratitude to God, while what
remains undone demands our most sincere prayers to, and
reliance upon, Him without whom all human effort is vain.
I recommend that all patriots, at their homes, in their places
of public worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common
thanksgiving and prayer to Almighty God."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a response to a serenade at the White House, on May 9,
1864, following the Battle of the Wilderness, Mr. Lincoln
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While we are grateful to all the brave men and officers
for the events of the past few days, we should, above all, be
very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us victory."</p></blockquote>

<p>May 18, 1864, in a letter of reply to a deputation of ministers
who presented to him resolutions adopted by the Methodist
General Conference, he said, "God bless the Methodist
Church&mdash;bless all the churches&mdash;and blessed be God, who, in
this our great trial giveth us the churches."</p>

<p>In a letter to a committee consisting of the Rev. Dr. Ide,
Honorable J. R. Doolittle, and Honorable A. Hubbell, May
30, 1864, Mr. Lincoln says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In response to the preamble and resolutions of the American
Baptist Home Mission Society, which you did me the
honor to present, I can only thank you for thus adding to
the effective and almost unanimous support which the Christian
communities are so zealously giving to the country, and
to liberty. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how it could be
otherwise with anyone professing Christianity, or even having
ordinary perceptions of right and wrong. To read the Bible,
as the word of God Himself, that 'In the sweat of <i>thy</i> face
shalt thou eat bread,' and to preach therefrom that, 'In the
sweat of <i>other men's</i> faces shalt thou eat bread,' to my mind
can scarcely be reconciled with honest sincerity. When
brought to my final reckoning may I have to answer for
robbing no man of his goods; yet more tolerable even this,
than for robbing one of himself and all that was his. When,
a year or two ago, those professedly holy men of the South
met in the semblance of prayer and devotion, and, in the name
of Him who said, 'As ye would all men should do unto you,
do ye even so unto them,' appealed to the Christian world
to aid them in doing to a whole race of men as they would
have no man do unto themselves, to my thinking they contemned
and insulted God and His church far more than did
Satan when he tempted the Saviour with the kingdoms of
earth. The devil's attempt was no more false, and far less
hypocritical. But let me forbear, remembering it is also
written, 'Judge not, lest ye be judged.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>On December 7, 1863, in making announcement of Union
success in East Tennessee, he closed as follows: "I recommend
that all loyal people do, on receipt of this information,
assemble at their places of worship and render special homage
and gratitude to Almighty God for His great advancement
of the national cause."</p>

<p>His Third Annual Message to Congress, December 8, 1863,
began: "Another year of health, and of sufficiently abundant
harvests, has passed. For these, and especially for the improved
condition of our national affairs, our renewed and
profoundest gratitude to God is due."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>After the capture of Mobile and Atlanta, on September 3,
1864, Mr. Lincoln issued his fourth special thanksgiving
proclamation, calling on all people to offer thanksgiving to God
"for His mercy in preserving our national existence"; and
also "that prayer be made for divine protection to our soldiers
and their leaders in the field, who have so often and so gallantly
periled their lives in battling with the enemy; and
for blessings and comforts from the Father of Mercies to the
sick, wounded, and prisoners, and to the orphans and widows
of those who have fallen in the service of their country, and
that He will continue to uphold the Government of the United
States against all the effects of public enemies and secret foes."</p>

<p>He issued a proclamation calling for thanksgiving for victories,
July 15, 1863:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has pleased Almighty God to hearken to the supplication
and prayers of an afflicted people, and to vouchsafe
to the army and navy of the United States victories on land
and on sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable
grounds for augmented confidence that the union of these
States will be maintained, their Constitution preserved, and
their peace and prosperity permanently restored. But these
victories have been accorded not without sacrifice of life,
limb, health, and liberty, incurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic
citizens. Domestic affliction in every part of the country
follows in the train of these fearful bereavements. It is meet
and right to recognize and confess the presence of the Almighty
Father and the power of His hand equally in these triumphs
and in these sorrows.</p>

<p>"Now, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday,
the 6th day of August next, to be observed as a day of
national thanksgiving, praise, and prayer, and I invite the
people of the United States to assemble on that occasion in
their customary places of worship, and, in the forms approved
by their own consciences, render the homage due to the Divine
Majesty for the wonderful things He has done in the nation's
behalf, and invoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless
and cruel rebellion, to change the hearts of the insurgents, to
guide the counsels of the government with wisdom adequate
to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender care
and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land
all those who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages,
battles, and sieges, have been brought to suffer in mind, body,
or estate, and finally to lead the whole nation through the
paths of repentance and submission to the Divine Will back
to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal peace."</p></blockquote>

<p>On March 30, 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation
appointing another national fast-day. It reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whereas, the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing
the supreme authority and just government of Almighty
God in all the affairs of men and of nations has by a
resolution requested the President to designate and set apart
a day for national prayer and humiliation:</p>

<p>"And whereas, it is the duty of nations as well as of men
to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God;
to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet
with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy
and pardon; and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in
the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those
nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord:</p>

<p>"And insomuch as we know that by His divine law nations,
like individuals, are subject to punishments and chastisements
in this world, and may we not justly fear that the awful
calamity of civil war which now desolates the land may be
but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous
sins, to the needful end of our national reformation as a
whole people? We have been the recipients of the choicest
bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved these many
years in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers,
wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown; but
we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand
which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and
strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>fulness
of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced
by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated
with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to
feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too
proud to pray to the God who made us:</p>

<p>"It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the
offended Power, and confess our national sins, and to pray
for clemency and forgiveness:</p>

<p>"Now, therefore, in compliance with the request and fully
concurring in the views of the Senate, I do by this my proclamation
designate and set apart Thursday, the 30th day of
April, 1863, as a day of national humiliation, fasting, and
prayer. And I do hereby request all the people to abstain on
that day from their ordinary secular pursuits, and to unite
at their several places of public worship and their respective
homes in keeping the day holy to the Lord, and devoted to
the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to that
solemn occasion. All this being done in sincerity and truth,
let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by divine teachings,
that the united cry of the nation will be heard on high,
and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our
national sins, and the restoration of our now divided and
suffering country to its former happy condition of unity and
peace."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1863 Washington's Birthday occurred on Sunday,
and Rev. Alexander Reed, superintendent of the United States
Christian Commission, invited Mr. Lincoln to preside at a
meeting in the House of Representatives on that day. In
reply Mr. Lincoln said: "Whatever shall be sincerely, and
in God's name, devised for the good of the soldier and seaman
in their hard spheres of duty, can scarcely fail to be
blest.... The birthday of Washington and the Christian
Sabbath coinciding this year, and suggesting together the
highest interests of this life and of that to come, is most
propitious for the meeting proposed."</p>

<p>January 5, 1863, in reply to a letter, Mr. Lincoln wrote
the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is most cheering and encouraging for me that in the
efforts which I have made and am making for the restoration
of a righteous peace for our country, I am upheld and sustained
by the good wishes and prayers of God's people. No one is
more deeply than myself aware that without His favor our
highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous
efforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure."</p>

<p>"I am conscious of no desire for my country's welfare
that is not in consonance with His will, and no plan upon
which we may not ask His blessing. It seems to me that if
there be one subject upon which all good men may unitedly
agree, it is imploring the gracious favor of the God of Nations
upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation
of their precious birthright of civil and religious liberty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Second Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with
a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light
He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way
all will be well."</p></blockquote>

<p>Reply to a committee of colored people who presented him
with a Bible, September 4, 1864:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This occasion would seem fitting for a lengthy response
to the address which you have just made. I would make one
if prepared; but I am not. I would promise to respond in
writing had not experience taught me that business will not
allow me to do so. I can only say now, as I have often
before said, it has always been a sentiment with me that all
mankind should be free. So far as able, within my sphere, I
have always acted as I believe to be right and just; and I have
done all I could for the good of mankind generally. In
letters and documents sent from this office, I have expressed
myself better than I now can.</p>

<p>"In regard to this great Book, I have but to say, it is the
best gift God has given to man. All the good Saviour gave
to the world was communicated through this Book. But for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
it we could not know right from wrong. All things most
desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be
found portrayed in it. To you I return my most sincere
thanks for this very elegant copy of the great Book of God
which you present."&mdash;Complete Works of Lincoln by John
G. Nicolay and John Hay. New and Enlarged Edition,
Twelve Volumes. New York: Francis D. Tandy Company,
1905, X, 217-18.</p></blockquote>

<p>Compiling these and kindred passages from his authentic
works, his two secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, were impressed
anew with the manifest sincerity and deep religious conviction
which they expressed. Commenting upon these as a whole,
and having particularly in mind certain stories which given
to the public could not, from their date and nature, have
been mere conventional expressions, and others so manifestly
personal that no consideration of the public opinion could
have had any weight with him, they said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was a man of profound and intense religious feeling.
We have no purpose of attempting to formulate his creed: we
question if he himself ever did so. There have been swift
witnesses who, judging from expressions uttered in his callow
youth, have called him an atheist; and others who, with the
most laudable intentions, have remembered improbable conversations
which they bring forward to prove at once his
orthodoxy and their own intimacy with him. But leaving
aside these apocryphal endeavors, we have only to look at his
authentic public and private utterances to see how deep and
strong in all the latter part of his life was the current of his
religious thought and emotion. He continually invited and
appreciated, at their highest value, the prayers of good people.
The pressure of the tremendous problems by which he was surrounded;
the awful moral significance of the conflict in which
he was the chief combatant; the overwhelming sense of personal
responsibility which never left him for an hour&mdash;all
contributed to produce, in a temperament naturally serious
and predisposed to a spiritual view of life and conduct, a
sense of reverent acceptance of the guidance of a superior
Power. From the morning when, standing amid the falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
snowflakes in the railway car at Springfield, he asked the
prayers of his neighbors in those touching phrases whose
echo rose that night in invocations from thousands of family
altars, to that memorable hour when on the steps of the Capitol
he humbled himself before his Creator in the sublime
words of the Second Inaugural, there is not an expression
known to have come from his lips or pen but proves that he
held himself answerable in every act of his career to a more
august tribunal than any on earth. The fact that he was not
a communicant of any church, and that he was singularly
reserved in regard to his personal religious life, gives only
the greater force to these striking proofs of his profound
reverence and faith.</p>

<p>"In final substantiation of this assertion, we subjoin two
papers from the hand of the President, one official and the
other private, which bear within themselves the imprint of a
sincere devotion and a steadfast reliance upon the power and
benignity of an overruling Providence. The first is an order
which he issued on the 16th of November, 1864, in the
observance of Sunday.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln's Sunday Rest Order, November 15, 1862:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The President, Commander-in-chief of the Army and
Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath
by the officers and men in the military and naval service.
The importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly
rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a
becoming deference to the best sentiments of a Christian
people, and a due regard for the Divine Will, demand that
Sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced to the measure
of strict necessity.</p>

<p>"The discipline and character of the national forces should
not suffer, nor the cause they defend be imperiled by the
profanation of the day or name of the Most High. 'At this
time of public distress'&mdash;adopting the words of Washington
in 1776&mdash;'men may find enough to do in the service of God
and their Country without abandoning themselves to vice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
immorality.' The first general order issued by the Father of
his Country, after the Declaration of Independence, indicates
the spirit in which our institutions were founded and should
ever be defended. 'The General hopes and trusts that every
officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a
Christian soldier defending the dearest rights and liberties of
his country.'</p>

<p>"The date of this remarkable order leaves no possibility
for the insinuation that it sprang from any political purposes
or intention. Mr. Lincoln had just been re-elected by an
overwhelming majority; his own personal popularity was
unbounded; there was no temptation for hypocrisy or deceit.
There is no explanation of the order except that it was the
offspring of sincere convictions.</p>

<p>"But if it may be said that this was, after all, an exoteric
utterance springing from those relations of religion and
good government which the wisest rulers have always recognized
in their intercourse with the people, we will give another
document of which nothing of the sort can be said. It is a
paper which Mr. Lincoln wrote in September, 1862, while his
mind was burdened with the weightiest question of his life,&mdash;the
weightiest with which this country has had to grapple.
Wearied with all the considerations of law and of expediency
with which he had been struggling for two years, he retired
within himself and tried to bring some order into his thoughts
by rising above the wrangling of men and parties, and pondering
the relations of human government to the Divine. In
this frame of mind, absolutely detached from any earthly
considerations, he wrote this meditation. It has never been
published. It was not written to be seen of men. It was
penned in the awful sincerity of a perfectly honest soul trying
to bring himself into closer communion with its Maker.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meditation on the Divine will, September [30], 1862:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The will of God prevails. In great contests each party
claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both
may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and
against the same thing at the same time. In the present Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
War it is quite possible that God's purpose is something
different from the purpose of either party; and yet the best
instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best
adaptation to effect His purpose. I am almost ready to say
that this is probably true: that God wills this contest, and
wills that it shall not end yet. By His mere great power on the
minds of the now contestants He could have saved or destroyed
the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began.
And, having begun, He could give the final victory to either
side any day. Yet the contest proceeds."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicolay and
Hay</span>, Life of Lincoln, <i>Century</i>, August, 1889. Vol. 35,

<p class="ph2">PART III: THE RELIGION OF LINCOLN</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="c">WHAT LINCOLN WAS NOT</p>


<p>It is amazing to discover how many forms of faith and non-faith
have claimed Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Seven cities strove for Homer, dead,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Through which the living Homer begged his bread.</i>"</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>More than seven churches have striven for the dead
Abraham Lincoln, some of whom would not even now admit
to their membership a living man who professed his sentiments.</p>

<p>Before we undertake the difficult task of assessing the real
faith of Abraham Lincoln, let us dispose of a few of the claims
that have been made on his behalf, or the charges that have
been made against him, and which clearly have no sufficient
weight of evidence. Let us ask first,</p>


<p><i>Was Abraham Lincoln an atheist?</i></p>

<p>Herndon declared that Lincoln was an infidel, "sometimes
bordering on atheism." This last phrase has been overstrained.
What Herndon appears to have meant was that
in some of Lincoln's blackest hours of gloom his mind hung
over that utter void; and he more than hints that in such hours
Lincoln's mind was scarcely sound. Herndon was far from
believing or meaning to charge that atheism was Lincoln's real
view of God and the world. The contrary is shown in a
score of places in Herndon's works and letters.</p>

<p>Some years ago the <i>Open Court</i> of Chicago contained an
article by Theodore Stanton, quoted from the <i>Westminster
Review</i>. It said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That Lincoln was an orthodox Christian nobody pretends
to assert. But his friends and biographers differ as to how
much of a Christian he was. If Lincoln had lived and died
an obscure Springfield lawyer and politician, he would unquestionably
have been classed by his neighbors among freethinkers.
But as is customary with the Church, whether
Roman Catholic or Protestant, when Lincoln became one of
the great of the world, an attempt was made to claim him....
The shrewd politician who has not an elastic conscience&mdash;and
that was Lincoln's case&mdash;simply keeps mum on
religious subjects, or, when he must touch on the subject,
deals only in platitudes, and this is just what Lincoln did.
Lincoln thought little on religious subjects, and read less.
That, when left to himself, he was quite indifferent to religion,
is frequently evident in the acts of his life."&mdash;<i>Open Court</i>,
September 24, 1891, pp. 2962-63, quoting <i>Westminster Review</i>
of September, 1890.</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement was not sufficiently radical for one reader
of the <i>Open Court</i>, who thought that Mr. Stanton had made
Lincoln out to have been virtually an agnostic, and who wished
to prove him an atheist. He wrote an article in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Free-thinker means anything or nothing.... Plain
words are the best. That Lincoln was <i>A-theos</i> connotes a
definite attitude toward the great religious chimera, and really
defines Mr. Lincoln's position more closely than any of Mr.
Stanton's epithets [as, e.g., Agnostic]. It is positive, not
negative, indicates what the man professedly was rather than
what he was not or what he oppugned. We are in position
to define his life-creed with all due measure of exactness."&mdash;"What
Was Abraham Lincoln's Creed?" by George M.
McCrie, <i>Open Court</i>, November 26, 1891.</p></blockquote>

<p>This writer then proceeded to define Mr. Lincoln's creed
in terms of atheism. But his argument was based on a subjective
scheme of philosophy, a kind of Hylo-Idealism derived
from Hegel more than from Lincoln, and one which it is safe
to affirm Lincoln would neither have admitted nor even
understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after, the same journal had a third and very
different article, which said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lincoln was an extremely religious man, though not a
technical Christian. He thought deeply, and his opinions
were positive. His seriousness was a characteristic trait,
showing itself even in his genuine good humor. His very
jokes were a part of his seriousness.... Lincoln was an
extremely practical man. He believed not for belief's sake,
but for his own sake. He made a practice of religion; he
used it. His religion was his life, and his life was his religious
service. It was his own public profession. Religion was a
fact to him. He believed in prayer, because he found use for
it: and when the fate of the Union seemed to waver, when
doubt and despair hovered over the land and the future was
uncertain, Lincoln often shut himself within his room and
offered up his prayer to God. 'So, many times,' he said, 'I
was forced to my knees, not knowing where else to go.'</p>

<p>"While there is considerable in his writings to indicate
a strong faith in God and prayer, there is little to indicate
his beliefs regarding Christ, the Bible, etc. But the very
absence of anything on those points is good evidence that he
did not hold the views that have been attributed to him....</p>

<p>"He was a firm believer in the 'great and good and merciful
God,' but not in a revengeful or cruel God who could
consign them to an eternal hell when nothing good to those
who suffered could possibly come from such punishment.
He believed in and used prayer as a means to bring himself
in closer relations with right in everything.... He believed
in 'universal inspiration and miracles under law,' and that
all things, both matter and mind, are governed by law. He
believed that all creation is an evolution under law, not a
special creation of the Supreme Being. He hoped for a
joyous meeting in the world to come with many loved ones
gone before. He believed that Christianity consists in being,
not believing; in loving 'the Lord thy God with all thy heart
and thy neighbor as thyself.' He believed that the Bible is
a book to be understood and appreciated as any other book,
not merely to be accepted as a divine creation of infallibility.
He believed in the man Christ, not in the God Christ....
He was once an admirer of Volney, Paine, and Voltaire; later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of Theodore Parker, Emerson, and Channing. He was once
a scoffer of religion; later a supporter."&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. C. Roper</span>, Religious
Beliefs of Abraham Lincoln, <i>Open Court</i>, 1903,
pp. 76-85.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever Abraham Lincoln was, he was not an atheist.
If any other convenient term were to be applied to him, it
would be necessary that the term itself should be defined.
Thus, Lyman Abbott has spoken of Lincoln as an agnostic,
meaning that Lincoln did not find himself in position to affirm
dogmatically on certain of the articles of faith. This article
by Dr. Abbott was particularly illuminating as discriminating
between the measure of uncertainty which a man may feel
in the matter of positive declaration of his views, while cherishing
in his heart and manifesting in his life the essentials
of a Christian faith. It was published as an editorial in
reply to a letter of inquiry, and both are worth reprinting
entire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'My dear Dr. Abbott: You are quoted in the New York
<i>Press</i> of October 15 as having referred in your Yale sermon
to Abraham Lincoln in the following terms: "Agnostic
though he was." Are you correct in the implication? If so,
I should greatly like to know, as it is a subject in which I am
much interested. J. G. Holland says, in his <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
page 61 ff., "He believed in God, and in His personal supervision
of the affairs of men.... This unwavering faith
in a divine Providence began at his mother's knee, and ran
like a thread of gold through all the inner experiences of his
life"; and much more to the same purpose. You are doubtless
familiar with his words on leaving Springfield for Washington:
"He [Washington] would never have succeeded except
for the aid of divine Providence upon which he at all times
relied. On that same Almighty Being I place my reliance.
Pray that I may receive that divine assistance without which
I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain." The
first inaugural would seem to indicate a most pronounced
Christian sentiment. Not to consume too much of your time,
I might refer further to Nicolay and Hay's <i>Life</i>, the following
passages: Vol. VI, p. 539, which contains a statement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Lincoln's religious principles; also, same volume, pp. 323, 324,
327, 328, 341, 342.</p>

<p class="r">
R. A. A.'"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this letter Dr. Abbott replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The life of Abraham Lincoln appears to me to furnish
a very striking illustration both of the difference between
theology and religion and of the way in which religious
experience is often developed in the life of a true man, and is
accompanied by a real though generally quite unconscious
change in theological opinion. Mr. Herndon, in his <i>Life of
Lincoln</i>, portrays the earlier religious faith of Mr. Lincoln,
Nicolay and Hay his later religious faith: neither biographer
is able to find that he ever formulated his own creed, neither
is able to formulate one for him. Yet between the religious
convictions of the period when he wrote an essay against
Christianity, which, fortunately for his reputation, a wise
friend threw into the fire, and the period when he wrote his
second inaugural address, there is a difference which cannot
be measured by the mere lapse of years.</p>

<p>"Agnostic? What is an agnostic? Huxley invented the
phrase to define his own position in contrast with that of
his friends whom he called gnostics because they had each
a theory of the universe and he had none. He more specifically
defines the basis of his no-theory of the universe in a
pathetic letter to Charles Kingsley (<i>Life and Letters</i>, Vol. II,
pp. 233-239): 'It is no use to talk to me of analogies and
probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in
the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my lifelong
hopes upon weaker convictions. I dare not, if I would.' Compare
with this Mr. Herndon's measure of Mr. Lincoln's earlier
habit of thought: 'As already expressed, Mr. Lincoln had no
faith. In order to believe, he must see and feel, and thrust
his hand into the place. He must taste, smell, or handle before
he had faith or even belief.' Or compare Mrs. Lincoln's
expression concerning her husband's religious opinions, as
quoted by Mr. Herndon: 'Mr. Lincoln had no faith and no
hope, in the usual acceptance of those words. He never joined
a church; but still, as I believe, he was a religious man by
nature. He first seemed to think about the subject when our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Willie died, and then more than ever about the time he went
to Gettysburg; but it was a kind of poetry in his nature;
and he was never a technical Christian.'</p>

<p>"Religion is always a kind of poetry. Faith is kin to
imagination; both faith and imagination look upon the unseen
and refuse to base life merely upon the senses or upon mathematical
formularies like the law of the inverse squares. This
poetry is often quite dissociated from philosophy, or is even
inconsistent with the philosophy which the individual entertains.
But Mr. Lincoln's early philosophy prepared for his
later religious experience. Mr. Herndon reports him as saying:
'There are no accidents in my philosophy. The past
is the cause of the present, and the present will be the cause
of the future. All these are links in the endless chain stretching
from the Infinite to the finite.' With this philosophy of
fatalism was a profound faith in justice, a profound reverence
for it, and an uncompromising obedience to it. At first he did
not put this philosophy and this faith together. He who does
put them together, that is, he who infuses this philosophy in
an overruling cause with this faith, which is a 'kind of
poetry,' in the supremacy of righteousness, comes to a faith
in a righteous God, who deserves our reverence, not because
he is great, but because he is good.</p>

<p>"When Abraham Lincoln began to feel the burden of
the nation resting upon him, and felt it too great a burden for
him to carry unaided, he wanted the sympathy of all men and
women in the country who with him believed in a Power directing
the course of human history greater than the actors in it,
and who also believed in eternal justice; and he asked their
prayers. As the conflict went on and the burden grew heavier
and heavier, his faith in righteousness more and more infused
his belief in a superhuman power and transformed it into a
belief in a righteous God; but it was, till the last, a belief in a
God of justice rather than a Christ of pity, even as it phrased
itself in that most religious utterance of his life, his second
inaugural: 'Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that
this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if
God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the
bondman's two hundred years of unrequited toil shall be
sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall
be paid with another drawn with the sword, as was said three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "The judgments
of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."'</p>

<p>"There is no evidence that Mr. Lincoln had become a
gnostic, or that he had a comprehensive scheme of the universe,
or that he had either wrought out a system of theology for
himself or accepted any that had been wrought out by others;
but there is abundant evidence that he had learned in the four
years of tragedy a lesson of dependence and trust, that he had
insensibly put together his belief in a supreme Power and his
faith in righteousness, and that thus there had been born in
him faith in a supreme righteous Power, whose will we may
help to carry out, and on whose wisdom and strength we may
rely in achieving it. It is thus that the life of Abraham
Lincoln illustrates both how a reverent agnostic may be deeply
religious and how the life of service and self-sacrifice leads
through doubt to faith.&mdash;L. A."&mdash;<i>The Outlook</i>, November 17,
1906.</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Was Abraham Lincoln a Roman Catholic?</i></p>

<p>The question is absurd, and worth asking only that it may
receive a simple negative answer. Yet, singularly, a report
was current and somewhat widely believed in 1860 that
Abraham Lincoln had been baptized as a Roman Catholic
and was himself a renegade from that faith. The rumor
appears to have had two roots. First was the fact that
much missionary work was done in early Illinois by Jesuit
priests; and it was assumed, not only contrary to every fact
but to every element of probability, that Abraham Lincoln
had been baptized by one of them. The other was the fact
that he acted as attorney for Rev. Charles Chiniquy, who
after fifty years in the Church of Rome came out from that
communion and became a notable antagonist of the church in
which he had been reared. His unsparing criticisms led to
various attacks upon him through the courts and otherwise.
When Lincoln was elected President much was made of the
fact that Lincoln had been Father Chiniquy's attorney, and
the rumor that he also was a renegade Catholic gained wide
currency.</p>

<p>Chiniquy professed to see in these rumors a peril to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
life of Mr. Lincoln, and both then and at intervals during
his administration warned the President that his life was in
danger. The scarcely concealed favor of the Vatican toward
the cause of the South did not tend to allay this anxiety.
The fact that among those concerned in the plot which finally
ended in the assassination of the President were several
Roman Catholics, revived these reports immediately after his
death, and they are occasionally recalled even now.</p>

<p>So far as our present inquiry is concerned, we have only
to ask and answer the question. Mr. Lincoln was not in any
period of his life affiliated in any way with the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>


<p><i>Was Abraham Lincoln a Spiritualist?</i></p>

<p>During Mr. Lincoln's occupancy of the White House,
there were several rumors to the effect that President and
Mrs. Lincoln were both Spiritualists. A definite claim that
Mr. Lincoln fully believed in Spiritualism was set forth in
1891 by a medium named Mrs. Nettie Colburn Maynard. She
wrote a book relating in detail almost innumerable sittings
which she alleged were attended by Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln.
According to her story her mediumship began in her childhood
in 1845. At the outbreak of the war she was lecturing
and giving public séances and went to Washington to gain a
furlough for her brother. She learned of Mr. Lincoln's
interest in Spiritualism, and of the visits to the White House
of two mediums, Charles Colchester and Charles Foster.
She was invited to the White House, where, if we are to
credit her story, she imparted to Mr. Lincoln very nearly all
the wisdom which he possessed during the period of the
Civil War.</p>

<p>We learn from other sources that Lincoln permitted two
or three mediums to come to the White House and to tell him
what the spirits said he ought to know; but Lincoln said of
them that the advice of the spirits, as thus received, was as
contradictory as the voices of his own Cabinet, of whose
meetings the séances reminded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The last attempt to make Mr. Lincoln out a Spiritualist
is by Mrs. Grace Garrett Durand, in a privately printed book
issued since Sir Oliver Lodge's <i>Raymond</i>. She claims to
have talked with Raymond, with William T. Stead, and other
people, as well as with Mrs. Eddy, from whom she expects to
receive additional material supplementary to her <i>Science and
Health, and Key to the Scriptures</i>. She is, however, according
to her own account, especially intimate with Mr. Lincoln.
She says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"President Lincoln has himself told me in many conversations
I have had with him from the spirit world that he
was directed in his great work during the Civil War by his
mother and others in the spirit world. Mr. Lincoln, or
'Uncle Abe,' as he has lovingly asked me to call him, said that
had he respected his mother's advice the day of his assassination
he would not have gone to the theater the fateful night,
as his mother had that day warned him not to go."</p></blockquote>

<p>If Mr. Lincoln's spirit has indeed requested this lady
to call him "Uncle Abe" he has accorded her a liberty which
was infrequent during his lifetime. Near neighbors of Mr.
Lincoln during his years in Springfield inform me that no
one called him "Abe" to his face, and that very few even
of his political opponents thus spoke of him. He habitually
addressed his partner as "Billy," but Mr. Herndon uniformly
called him "Mr. Lincoln." One could wish that Abraham
Lincoln in heaven might be at least as dignified as Abraham
Lincoln was on earth.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>


<p><i>Was Abraham Lincoln superstitious?</i></p>

<p>Both President and Mrs. Lincoln were superstitious.
They believed in dreams and signs, he more in dreams and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
she more in signs. When Mrs. Lincoln was away from him
for a little time, visiting in Philadelphia in 1863, and Tad
with her, Lincoln thought it sufficiently important to telegraph,
lest the mail should be too slow, and sent her this message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
"Executive Mansion,<br />
"Washington, June 9, 1863.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lincoln</span>,<br />
"Philadelphia, Pa.
</p>

<p>"Think you better put Tad's pistol away. I had an
ugly dream about him.</p>

<p class="r">
"A. Lincoln."
</p>

<p>&mdash;Quoted in facsimile in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for February,
1897; <i>Lincoln's Home Life in the White House</i>, by
Leslie J. Perry.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Lamon's book of <i>Recollections</i>, published in 1895, a
very different book from his Life of Lincoln, he devotes an
entire chapter to Lincoln's dreams and presentiments. He
relates the story of the dream which Lincoln had not long
before his assassination wherein he saw the East Room of
the White House containing a catafalque with the body of an
assassinated man lying upon it. Lincoln tried to remove
himself from the shadow of this dream by recalling a story
of life in Indiana, but could not shake off the gloom of it.
Lamon says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was no dabbler in divination, astrology, horoscopy,
prophecy, ghostly lore, or witcheries of any sort.... The
moving power of dreams and visions of an extraordinary
character he ascribed, as did the Patriarchs of old, to the
Almighty Intelligence that governs the universe, their processes
conforming strictly to natural laws."&mdash;<i>Recollections</i>, p. 120.</p></blockquote>

<p>In his Life of Lincoln, Lamon tells the story of the dream
which Lincoln had late in the year 1860, when resting upon
a lounge in his chamber he saw his figure reflected in a mirror
opposite with two images, one of them a little paler than the
other. It worried Lincoln, and he told his wife about it. She
thought it was "a sign that Lincoln was to be elected for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
second term and that the paleness of one of the faces indicated
that he would not see life through the last term" (p. 477).</p>

<p>As this optical illusion has been so often printed, and has
seemed so weirdly prophetic of the event which followed, it
may be well to quote an explanation of the incident from
an address by Dr. Erastus Eugene Holt, of Portland, Maine:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As he lay there upon the couch, every muscle became
relaxed as never before.... In this relaxed condition, in
a pensive mood and in an effort to recuperate the energies of
a wearied mind, his eyes fell upon the mirror in which he
could see himself at full length, reclining upon the couch.
All the muscles that direct, control, and keep the two eyes
together were relaxed; the eyes were allowed to separate, and
each eye saw a separate and distinct image by itself. The
relaxation was so complete, for the time being, that the two
eyes were not brought together, as is usual by the action of
converging muscles, hence the counterfeit presentiment of
himself. He would have seen two images of anything else
had he looked for them, but he was so startled by the ghostly
appearance that he felt 'a little pang as though something
uncomfortable had happened,' and obtained but little rest.
What a solace to his wearied mind it would have been if
someone could have explained this illusion upon rational
grounds!"&mdash;Address at Portland, Maine, February 12, 1901,
reprinted by William Abbatt, Tarrytown, N. Y., 1916.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other incidents which relate to Mr. Lincoln's faith in
dreams, including one that is said to have occurred on the
night preceding his assassination, are well known, and need not
be repeated here in detail.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to seek to evade or minimize the
element of superstition in Lincoln's life, nor to ask to explain
away any part of it. Dr. Johnson admits it in general terms,
but makes little of concrete instances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The claim that there was more or less of superstition in
his nature, and that he was greatly affected by his dreams,
is not to be disputed. Many devout Christians today are
equally superstitious, and, also, are greatly affected by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
dreams. Lincoln grew in an atmosphere saturated with all
kinds of superstitious beliefs. It is not strange that some of
it should cling to him all his life, just as it was with Garfield,
Blaine, and others.</p>

<p>"In 1831, then a young man of twenty-two, Lincoln
made his second trip to New Orleans. It was then that he
visited a Voodoo fortune teller, that is so important in the
eyes of certain people. This, doubtless, was out of mere
curiosity, for it was his second visit to a city. This no more
indicates a belief in 'spiritualism' than does the fact that a
few days before he started on this trip he attended an exhibition
given by a traveling juggler, and allowed the magician
to cook eggs in his low-crowned, broad-rimmed hat."&mdash;<i>Lincoln
the Christian</i>, p. 29.</p></blockquote>

<p>I do not agree with this. Superstition was inherent in
the life of the backwoods, and Lincoln had his full share of
it. Superstition is very tenacious, and people who think that
they have outgrown it nearly all possess it. "I was always
superstitious," wrote Lincoln to Joshua F. Speed on July 4,
1842. He never ceased to be superstitious.</p>

<p>While superstition had its part in the life and thought
of Lincoln, it was not the most outstanding fact in his thinking
or his character. For the most part his thinking was
rational and well ordered, but it had in it many elements and
some strange survivals&mdash;strange until we recognize the many
moods of the man and the various conditions of his life and
thought in which from time to time he lived.</p>


<p><i>Was Lincoln a Quaker?</i></p>

<p>In his autobiographical sketch written for Jesse W. Fell,
Mr. Lincoln stated that his paternal grandfather, Abraham
Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to
Kentucky about 1781 or 1782; "his ancestors, who were
Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County, Pennsylvania."
This reference to a remote Quaker ancestry has suggested to
some writers the possibility that Mr. Lincoln himself may have
been, in conviction, a Quaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>This suggestion is utilized to its full value and beyond by
Henry Bryan Binns, the first English biographer of Lincoln,
whose book appeared in 1907, and others have followed his
intimations. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In some brief autobiographical notes, Lincoln remarks
that his ancestors, when they left Berks County, Pennsylvania,
were Quakers. The allusion has significance, not merely
because it is the only reference to any religious body in these
notes, but because it suggests an interesting spiritual affiliation
to which we shall refer again later."</p></blockquote>

<p>He fulfills this promise, and refers to it repeatedly. The
Quaker ancestry finds reinforcement in his assurance that the
Shipley strain in Nancy Hanks was "probably" Quaker.
These references occur a number of times in the early part of
his book, and recur in the concluding chapter with more than
a suggestion that Mr. Lincoln continued to bear some of the
inherited spiritual qualities of the Quaker.</p>

<p>These suggestions lack evidential value. Lincoln's grandfather's
ancestors were believed by him to have been Quakers
in Pennsylvania, and their ancestors are believed to have been
Puritans in Massachusetts. But the New Englanders no more
surely dropped their Massachusetts Puritanism in Pennsylvania
than the Pennsylvania Quakers dropped their Quakerism in
Virginia and Kentucky. The Quaker ancestry was not forgotten
nor was it a thing to be ashamed of, but the distinctive
tenets of the Friends had no large part in the working creed
of Abraham Lincoln. He respected the Quakers, and on more
than one occasion showed his interest in them; but there is
no reason to believe that he shared either their theology or
their theory of non-resistance. He was compelled to approve
some severe measures against American citizens who refused
to fight, and a number of Quakers suffered in consequence.
Lincoln saw no way to prevent these sufferings altogether,
though he did his best to mitigate them, and he always
respected the principles of those who held in sincerity the
Quaker faith which he did not share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Was Lincoln a Unitarian or a Universalist?</i></p>

<p>It is my opinion that Lincoln did not believe in endless
punishment, and also that he did not accept the supernatural
birth of Christ. The evidence on which these opinions rest
has already been indicated. But I do not regard him as a
Universalist or a Unitarian. The basis of his religious belief
was Calvinism of the most rigid sort. It could accept some
incidental features of other systems, but at heart it was
Calvinistic.</p>

<p>I have talked with Rev. Jasper Douthit, of Shelbyville,
concerning Unitarianism in central Illinois. He quotes Jenkin
Lloyd Jones as saying of his Shelbyville church, that
"Unitarianism attempted to locate in the Capitol City of Illinois,
but struck the dome of the State House, glanced off, and
stuck in the mud at Shelbyville." In some sense the movement
of Mr. Douthit is the present survival of the attempt
before the Civil War to domesticate Unitarianism in Springfield
and vicinity. I have clipped from the <i>Christian Register</i>
a communication which, without pretending to technical knowledge
of the organific principle of the several sects, goes near
to the heart of this question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"To the editor of the Christian Register:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>Apropos</i> of 'Lincoln Day,' may I ask for <i>definite
information</i> as to Mr. Lincoln's religious belief? The author
of that little pamphlet, 'What do Unitarians Believe?' implies
that he is to be numbered among Unitarians, and quotes from
the author of <i>Six Months at the White House</i> to prove his
assertion. Now I don't know <i>who</i> the <i>author</i> of <i>Six Months
at the White House is</i>, and care less. His testimony is 'second
hand' viewed in any light you please. He may have been a
Unitarian himself, though I hardly think he would have used
the word 'Saviour,' in speaking of Mr. Lincoln's words,
unless Lincoln himself had used it. At any rate, the only
<i>direct</i> testimony bearing on Mr. Lincoln's religious views is
found in <i>his own writings</i>, and I want to quote from his
Fast Day proclamation of March 30, 1863, as throwing some
light on the subject.</p>

<p>"He says: 'Whereas, it is the duty of nations, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
as of men, to own their dependence upon the overruling
power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions in
humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance
will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime
truth announced in the Holy Scriptures, and proven by all
history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the
Lord.</p>

<p>"'And, insomuch as we know that by His Divine laws,
nations, like individuals, are subjected to punishments and
chastisements in this world, may we not justly fear that the
awful calamity of Civil War, which now desolates the land,
may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous
sins, to the needful end of our national reformation as a
whole people? We have been the recipients of the choicest
bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved these many
years in peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>"'We have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no
other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God.
We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in
peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and
we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts,
that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom
and virtue of our own.'</p>

<p>"If this isn't <i>Calvinism</i> pure and simple, then I don't
know what Calvinism is.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Editor, if you can show me any reference in
<i>Mr. Lincoln's own words</i> that point as strongly toward
'Unitarianism' and those truths which <i>it</i> claims as peculiarly
its own, I shall be glad to see it.</p>

<p class="r">
"<span class="smcap">Charles B. Toleman.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>A number of Lincoln's old neighbors, contributing to the
Irwin article in denial of the alleged infidelity of Lincoln,
affirm that he was a Universalist. In their denial of his
infidelity they were correct; and also in their detection of
the fallacy of Herndon in which he counted every opinion
to be infidel that did not conform to the severe orthodoxy
with which he was familiar. As between Herndon and these
writers, they were correct. Lincoln's "infidelity" consisted
in good part of his denial of eternal punishment. But that did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
not make him an infidel; neither did it constitute him technically
a Universalist. The substratum of his belief was the
old-time predestinarianism which he heard in his youth and
never outgrew. How he could make this blend with his
wide departures from conventional orthodoxy in other points,
those can best understand who have heard the kind of preaching
on which Lincoln grew up. Its effect is not easily
obliterated.</p>


<p><i>Was Abraham Lincoln a Methodist?</i></p>

<p>This question would seem to require no answer, yet it is
one that should receive an answer, for claims have been
made, and are still current, which imply that Lincoln was
actually converted in the Methodist Church, whose doctrine
he accepted because Calvinism was repugnant to him; and
that while he continued to attend the Presbyterian Church,
he was essentially a Methodist.</p>

<p>Lincoln had a very high regard for the Methodist Church.
It was rent asunder during the Civil War, and the Northern
branch of the church which had long been vigorously anti-slavery
was warmly loyal. On May 18, 1864, in a letter of
reply to a deputation of ministers from that body, he said,
"God bless the Methodist Church&mdash;bless all the churches, and
blessed be God who, in this our great trial, giveth us the
churches."</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the fact that Methodism did
not at any time appear greatly to influence the Lincoln family
in matters of theology, and that the early environment of the
family from the birth of Lincoln was Baptist. I am inclined
to think that the Hanks family had Methodist antecedents.
Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were married by a Methodist
preacher, Rev. Jesse Head. He is known to have been a
foe of slavery, and there is some reason to think that the
Lincoln family derived some part of its love of freedom
from him.</p>

<p>From time to time Lincoln met Methodist preachers who
deeply impressed him. One of these was Rev. Peter Akers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
whom he heard in 1837, when Lincoln was twenty-eight years
of age.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He and a group of associates went out to hear him at a
camp-meeting six miles west of Springfield, at the 'Salem
Church.' The Rev. Peter Akers was a vigorous and fearless
man. He spoke of certain prophecies, and predicted 'the
downfall of castes, the end of tyrannies, and the crushing out
of slavery.' On the way home they were earnestly discussing
the sermon. Lincoln is alleged to have said: 'It was the
most instructive sermon, and he is the most impressive
preacher, I have ever heard. It is wonderful that God has
given such power to men. I firmly believe his interpretation
of prophecy, so far as I understand it, and especially about
the breaking down of civil and religious tyrannies; and, odd
as it may seem, I was deeply impressed that I should be somehow
strangely mixed up with them."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tarbell</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
I, 237.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the lecture on Abraham Lincoln by Bishop Fowler, as
finally prepared for the press, is an incident which apparently
was not in its earlier editions. At a reunion of the Seventy-third
Illinois Volunteers, held in Springfield on September 28,
29, 1897, the colonel of that regiment, Rev. James F. Jacquess,
D.D., related an incident in which he stated that while he was
serving a Methodist Church in Springfield in 1839, Mr. Lincoln
attended a series of revival services held in that church, and
was converted. The story was heard with great interest by
the old soldiers of that regiment, many of whose officers had
been Methodist preachers, and it was printed in the Minutes
of the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Reunion of Survivors
of the Seventy-third Illinois Infantry.</p>

<p>Twelve years later, in 1909, in connection with the Centenary
Celebration of the birth of Lincoln, the story was
reprinted, with certain added details obtained from the brother
of Colonel Jacquess. As thus wrought into literary form, it
was printed in the New York <i>Christian Advocate</i> in an article
entitled "The Conversion of Lincoln," by Rev. Edward L.
Watson, of Baltimore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>Already Bishop Fowler, to whom Colonel Jacquess alluded
in his address at Springfield as having no adequate account of
Lincoln's conversion, had accepted the story and incorporated
it into the final version of his famous lecture (<i>Patriotic Orations</i>,
p. 102). The death of Colonel Jacquess and the additions
made by his brother give this incident its permanent
form in the <i>Christian Advocate</i> article of November 11, 1909.</p>

<p>I am glad to have been able to obtain from the <i>Christian
Advocate</i> their last copy of that issue, outside their office file,
and it appears in full in the Appendix to this volume. It may
be accepted as the authoritative form of this story.</p>

<p>That the story as told by Colonel Jacquess must have had
some element of truth I think beyond question; that it occurred
exactly as he related it, I greatly doubt. The years between
1839 and 1897 numbered fifty-eight, and that is more than
ample time for a man's memory to magnify and color incidents
almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>The story as it is thus told lacks confirmatory evidence.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
If Lincoln was converted in a Methodist Church in 1839 and
remained converted, a considerable number of events which
occurred in subsequent years might reasonably have been
expected to have been otherwise than they really were. Each
reader must judge for himself in the light of all that we know
of Abraham Lincoln how much or how little of this story is
to be accepted as literal fact. The present writer cannot
say that he is convinced by the story.</p>


<p><i>Was Abraham Lincoln a Freemason?</i></p>

<p>In an address delivered before Harmony Lodge, in Washington,
D. C., on January 28, 1914, Dr. L. D. Carman delivered
an address, which has since been printed, entitled "Abra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>ham
Lincoln, Freemason." In this address it was set forth
that "It was not an unusual practice in the early days of
Masonry in this country in sparsely settled localities, remote
from an active lodge, for several members of the fraternity
to get together, form an emergent or occasional lodge, and
make Masons." Abraham Lincoln was presumed to have
been made such a Mason because of utterances of his, quoted
at length, which appeared to show familiarity with Masonic
usage.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Those utterances, when examined, carry no such presumption,
nor was there any occasion for such an emergent lodge.
A lodge existed at Petersburg, near New Salem, and a number
of Lincoln's friends belonged to it; their names are on record.
The records of the Springfield Lodge, also, are preserved,
and bear no mention of his name; nor is there any evidence
so far as the present author knows that on any occasion he
was ever in a Masonic Lodge. Orators may use the symbolic
language of architecture without knowledge of speculative
Masonry, and Lincoln used it so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>

<p class="c">WHY DID LINCOLN NEVER JOIN THE CHURCH?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Lewis</span>, attorney in Springfield with an office on
the same floor and an elder in the First Presbyterian Church,
informs us that there was some real expectation that Lincoln
would have united with that church in Springfield after his
views had been modified through the influence of Dr. Smith.
He says that Lincoln attended with considerable regularity
a series of revival meetings in progress in the church, but
was out of town when application was made for church membership
and the officers of the church were disappointed that
he did not then unite.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Phineas D. Gurley, of Washington, tells of conversations
with Lincoln concerning religion and of some
expressed desires on the part of Lincoln for church fellowship.
His feeling of support in prayer was manifest in his
coming to the mid-week prayer service, where, however, as
Dr. Gurley affirms, he commonly sat in the pastor's room with
an open door, hearing the prayers that were offered but preferring
not to attract attention by his visible presence.</p>

<p>The best statement, and one that has been accepted as
truly representative of Lincoln's feeling with regard to church
membership, is one that comes to us on thoroughly good
authority and from the period immediately following Lincoln's
death.</p>

<p>Hon. Henry C. Deming, member of Congress from
Connecticut, in a memorial address given before the Legislature
of Connecticut, June 8, 1865, related that he had asked
Mr. Lincoln why he never united with a church, and Mr.
Lincoln answered:</p>

<p>"I have never united myself to any church, because I
have found difficulty in giving my assent, without mental
reservation, to the long, complicated statements of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
doctrine which characterize their articles of belief and confessions
of faith. When any church will inscribe over its
altars, as its sole qualification for membership, the Saviour's
condensed statement of the substance of both law and gospel,
'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor
as thyself,' that church will I join with all my heart and all
my soul" (p. 42).</p>

<p>To his Washington pastor, Rev. Phineas D. Gurley, he
said that he could not accept, perhaps, all the doctrines of his
Confession of Faith, "but," said he, "if all that I am asked
to respond to is what our Lord said were the two great commandments,
to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
mind and soul and strength, and my neighbor as myself, why,
I aim to do that."</p>

<p>Mr. Henry B. Rankin, who wrote his <i>Reminiscences</i> in
1916, states that he was a boy in Lincoln's office and his
parents knew Lincoln intimately during his years of struggle
in New Salem. Mr. Rankin's recollection of a conversation
which Lincoln had with Mr. Rankin's mother indicates that
Lincoln had some such feeling as far back as his New Salem
days. The Rankin family were warm friends of Peter
Cartwright, whom they called Uncle Peter, and also of Mr.
Lincoln. Mrs. Rankin asked him concerning the rumor that
he was an infidel, and Lincoln denied it; but being pressed to
explain why he did not then confess his Christian faith, he
gave to her much the answer which in later years he gave
to Mr. Deming and to Dr. Gurley (<i>Reminiscences of Lincoln</i>,
pp. 324-26).</p>

<p>I think, then, we are compelled to accept this threefold
testimony as establishing beyond any reasonable doubt the
answer that Lincoln himself gave to the question, why he did
not unite with the Church. It is a great pity that he was
not brought into contact with some form of organized Christianity,
orthodox and constructive in its essential teachings,
but with conditions of church membership as broad as those
of entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Churches have
learned a little better than they understood in 1846 that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
church creed should be a testimony and not a test; that it is
entirely consistent with the organization and ideal of a thoroughly
orthodox church to receive into its membership any
and every person who loves God and his fellow-man even
though he doubts thirty-eight of the thirty-nine articles of
the creed and is more or less uncertain about the other one.</p>

<p>But we cannot consider the question of Lincoln's possible
church membership and his failure to acquire it without
asking whether the fault was wholly that of the churches.
Other men beside Abraham Lincoln were more liberal than
the churches, including old Mentor Graham, but were able
to find a home there; though Graham was ultimately turned
out of the so-called "hardshell" church for his warm advocacy
of the principles of temperance. Some share of the
responsibility for his failure to unite with the Church must
belong to Lincoln himself.</p>

<p>It is a hazardous thing to suggest any element short of
perfection in the life or thought of any popular hero. Nevertheless
let us remind ourselves that Lincoln had the defects of
his qualities.</p>

<p>Lincoln lacked some of the finer feelings. He combined
a deep personal sympathy for anything which he could visualize
with a rather strange mental obtuseness toward things remote
or abstract. Darwin, who was born in the same year, had
an early love of poetry and music. How these tastes became
atrophied in his concentration of thought upon matters relating
to the natural sciences was confessed and mourned by
him, and has often been commented upon by others. The
time came to him when music and poetry gave him physical
nausea. Lincoln never had an appreciation or love of anything
very fine either in poetry or music. At a time when he
was being considered for President he could sit in a stage
coach playing "Yankee Doodle" on the mouth-organ<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and
playing it badly, but he had no fine musical or poetic taste.</p>

<p>Not long before his assassination his sister-in-law, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Edwards, visited at the White House, and he accompanied
her one evening to the conservatory. She greatly admired
the rare exotics which she there beheld for the first time, and
Lincoln vainly strove to share her enthusiasm but confessed
to her that something had been left out of his nature. Such
things seemed to make no appeal to him.</p>

<p>Of Lincoln's lack in matters involving the finer feelings
we have abundant testimony not only in the pages of Lamon
and Herndon, but in other intimate sketches of his life in
Illinois, as, for example, in Whitney's <i>With Lincoln on the Circuit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
and especially in his article in the <i>Arena</i> in April, 1898.
There were aspects of religion which did not make as strong
an appeal to Abraham Lincoln as they would have made but
for this blind spot in his nature.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this book to go in any detail into
Mr. Lincoln's love affairs; but if any further illustration were
desired of this point of which we are speaking, it could be
found very painfully in his relations with Miss Owens, and
his letter to Mrs. Browning.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to a certain lack of good taste
which Lincoln sometimes manifested, and of which the reminiscences
of Lamon, Herndon, Whitney, and others of his associates
have given us sufficient example. But it was not always
so with Lincoln. There was in him an innate courtesy, an
intuitive sympathy, an ability to adapt himself to another's
point of view, which gave him the essential quality of a
gentleman. Fred Douglass said of him that Mr. Lincoln was
the only white man with whom he ever talked for an hour who
did not in some way remind him that he was a negro. That
same fine feeling showed itself in many ways.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, too, when his uncouthness of
apparel is recalled, that while he was always a careless man in
his dress, the period in which he lived was one in which people
of the regions where he formed his lifelong habits were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
given to fastidious dress. He dressed much as other men
dressed. The shawl which he wore was such a shawl as the
author's father wore; such as many men wore. It was a mark
of good breeding rather than the reverse, and some men wore
the shawl very effectively for purposes of display. The author
himself has often carried with him in long rides in the southern
mountains what was called a "saddle-shawl" not unlike that
of Lincoln; and he now owns such a shawl, bequeathed to him
by one of Lincoln's contemporaries, and of the same color and
approximately the same size that Lincoln used.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jane Martin Johns of Decatur, died recently at the
age of ninety-two. Her mind was clear and her memory precise.
She has left this, among other memories of Lincoln, as
a reminder that he was a gentleman, and that at times he
showed the finest discrimination and good taste:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I first knew Mr. Lincoln, he was forty years old;
had been a member of the state legislature and of congress;
had traveled the circuit with men of culture and refinement;
had met great statesmen and elegant gentlemen; and the ungainliness
of the pioneer, if he ever had it, had worn off and
his manner was that of a gentleman of the old school, unaffected,
unostentatious, who arose at once when a lady entered
the room, and whose courtly manners would put to shame the
easy-going indifference to etiquette which marks the twentieth
century gentleman.</p>

<p>"His dress, like his manner, was suited to the occasion,
but was evidently a subject to which he gave little thought.
It was certainly unmarked by any notable peculiarity. It was
the fashion of the day for men to wear large shawls and Mr.
Lincoln's shawl, very large, very soft, and very fine, is the
only article of his dress that has left the faintest impression on
my memory. He wore it folded lengthwise (three and one-half
yards long) in scarf fashion over his shoulders, caught
together under the chin with an immense safety-pin. One end
of the shawl was thrown across his breast and over the
shoulder, as he walked up the steps of the Macon House one
day in December, 1849.</p>

<p>"Court was in session in Decatur, Judge David Davis presiding.
The hotel, where I was living temporarily, was kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
by David Krone and his good lady, whose popularity extended
over the fourteen counties of the Eighth Judicial District.</p>

<p>"Court week was always anticipated with great interest by
the people of the county seat. It was customary for the entire
bar of the district to follow the court from county to county,
every man either seeking new business, or as counsel in cases
already on the docket. The date of their arrival at any particular
county seat could not be definitely fixed, as the judge
held court at his pleasure, usually trying to finish all the business
ahead before he migrated to the next station.</p>

<p>"He was followed by a curious crowd. Lawyers, clients,
witnesses, itinerant peddlers, showmen, and gamblers filled the
towns to overflowing. It was no unusual thing for men who
had no business in the court, to follow from town to town
merely seeking entertainment. Social events of any moment
were wont to be arranged for court week, as the harvest time
when strangers could be taken in. Taverns were crowded and
the hospitality of the people was taxed to the utmost limit.</p>

<p>"To the men of the town, who always crowded the court
house, the examination of witnesses and the speeches of the
lawyers furnished an intellectual treat, for there were giants
at that bar. There was David Davis, the companionable judge,
who knew the law and who loved a laugh. And there were
Stephen Logan the scholarly, and Stuart the shrewd and
kindly, Swett the clever, and Browning the handsome, and
Lamon the amusing, and Weldon and Gridley and Parks and
Harmon and Ficklin and Linder and Whitney and Oliver L.
Davis, and the best beloved Abraham Lincoln. Some of them
traveled to only two or three counties, but Judge Davis, Mr.
Lincoln and Leonard Swett went the whole circuit; Davis
because he had to, Lincoln because he loved it, and Swett
because he loved their company.</p>

<p>"The Macon House was an oasis in the wilderness of
miserable inns at which they were usually compelled to 'put
in.' In Decatur they found clean beds, good bread and an
abundance of the good things of the season, administered by a
genial landlady who greeted them all as friends.</p>

<p>"It was in court week that my piano, after a long journey
by steamer down the Ohio and up the Wabash to Crawfordsville,
Ind., and thence by wagon, arrived in Decatur. The
wagon was backed up to the steps at the front door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Macon House and the question of how to unload it and get
it into the house was a puzzling one. Not a man except the
landlord was to be found, but he soon solved the problem.
"Court will soon adjourn and there will be plenty of men,"
and almost as he spoke the crowd began to appear. They
gathered curiously around the wagon that blocked the entrance.
Landlord Krone explained:</p>

<p>"'There is a piano in that box that this woman here wants
someone to help unload. Who will lend a hand?'</p>

<p>"A tall gentleman stepped forward and, throwing off a
big gray Scotch shawl, exclaimed, 'Come on, Swett, you are
the next biggest man.'</p>

<p>"That was my first meeting with Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>"After a few moments' consultation with the driver of
the wagon, Mr. Lincoln went into the basement where Mr.
Krone had a carpenter shop, and returned with two heavy
timbers across his shoulders. With them he established communication
between the wagon and the front door steps. The
piano was unloaded with the assistance of Mr. Linder and
Mr. Swett, amid jokes and jeers galore, most of the jeers
coming from little Judge Logan.</p>

<p>"Before the legs had been screwed into place, dinner was
announced, and the men hurried to the back porch where two
tin wash basins, a long roller towel and a coarse comb,
fastened to the wall by a long string, afforded toilet accommodations
for all guests. When dinner was served, 'Mother
Krone' placed a roast of beef in front of Dr. Trowbridge to
be carved and exclaimed, 'Men, if you can't get your teeth
through this beef you will have to fall back on the sausage.
I agreed to try roasting it without parboiling it, and I am
afraid it will be tougher than it was yesterday, and that was
bad enough.'</p>

<p>"The beef, however, proved to be tender and juicy and
was highly praised by the guests. I recall this incident because
Mr. Lincoln once reminded me of it, saying that 'that
was the time he learned that roast beef ought not to be boiled.'</p>

<p>"After dinner, Mr. Lincoln superintended the setting up
of the piano, even to seeing that it stood squarely in the center
of the wall space allotted it, and then received my thanks with
a polite bow and asked: 'Are you expecting to follow the court
and give concerts?' The immense relief expressed on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
countenance, when he was assured that he would not be
called upon to repeat the performance was very laughable.</p>

<p>"'Then may we have one tune before we go?' he asked,
and I played 'Rosin the Bow,' with variations.</p>

<p>"Someone shouted, 'Come on, boys, the judge will be
waiting,' and after I had assured them that if they desired it,
I would give my 'first and only concert on this circuit' when
they returned to the hotel in the evening, the crowd
dispersed.</p>

<p>"Here I wish to note that in the crowd that had assembled
to watch the unloading of the piano, the members of
the bar, Mr. Lincoln's friends and equals, always addressed
him as 'Mr. Lincoln,' while to the rabble and hangers-on he
was often 'Abe.'</p>

<p>"The piano was a 'Gilbert,' made in Boston, and its fame
extended far and wide. It was visited by people from all over
the state, stage coach passengers frequently 'holding the stage'
while they went down to the other tavern (the Harrell House
was the stage office) to see and hear the novel instrument.</p>

<p>"That evening a notable crowd assembled in the parlor of
the Macon House. Judge Davis, who did not put up with
Landlord Krone but was the guest of Mrs. A. A. Powers, came
in after supper; and practically all of the bar of the Eighth
Judicial District was present at what I suppose we would now
call a recital. I found that Mr. Charles Brown, a wealthy
landowner and stock dealer of McLean County, not only sang
but played a little and I called on him for assistance.</p>

<p>"The program, as I remember it, will illustrate the style
of music in vogue at that period.</p>

<p>"For show pieces, I played the 'Battle of Prague' and
the 'Carnival of Venice,' then followed with 'Washington's
March,' 'Come Haste to the Wedding,' and 'Woodup Quick
Step' to convince the audience that I did know a tune or two.
For tragedy, I sang Henry Russel's 'Maniac' and 'The Ship
on Fire,' and then made their blood run cold with the wild
wail of the 'Irish Mother's Lament.' For comic, we sang
'The Widdy McGee' and 'I Won't Be a Nun,' topping off
with 'Old Dan Tucker,' 'Lucy Long,' and 'Jim Crow,' the
crowd joining in the chorus. These were followed by more
serious music. Mr. Brown and Mr. Swett joined me in the
duet 'Moonlight, Music, Love, and Flowers,' 'Rocked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Cradle of the Deep,' 'Pilgrim Fathers,' 'Bonaparte's Grave,'
and 'Kathleen Mavourneen.' Each and all met with
applause.</p>

<p>"As a finale, I sang 'He Doeth All Things Well,' after
which Mr. Lincoln, in a very grave manner, thanked me for
the evening's entertainment, and said: 'Don't let us spoil that
song by any other music tonight.' Many times afterwards I
sang that song for Mr. Lincoln and for Governor Oglesby,
with whom it was also a favorite."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another limitation must be found in Lincoln's morbid
cautiousness. Herndon tells us that his very walk gave the
impression of craftiness; that it was not the product of deceit,
but only of a caution so excessive that it became something
more than second nature. He was secretive to a marked
degree. When he seemed to be confidential it was in minor
matters, or matters on which he had already made up his
mind and intended soon to make a public statement. Whatever
may be the true story of his engagement to Mary Todd
and of those stormy and obscure months between "that fatal
first of January, 1840," and the date of their wedding, November
4, 1842, Lincoln's letters to Speed show an excess of
caution that was positively abnormal. That it was a mark of
insanity has been vigorously denied and with much apparent
reason; but if it was not the mark of acute mental aberration,
it was the manifestation of a permanent mental trait. Such a
nature, which debated like Hamlet the question of suicide
and actually printed a brief article which was later cut from
the files of the Springfield paper&mdash;probably by Lincoln himself&mdash;which
lingered shivering on the brink of matrimony
like the "timorous mortal" of whom Lincoln was taught to
sing, must have hesitated long before coming to such a confident
poise between alternating faith and doubt as that he
could have stood before the altar of a Presbyterian church in
Springfield or in Washington and taken upon him the vows
of church membership.</p>

<p>Different writers have attempted to account for Lincoln's
failure to affiliate with the church wholly on the basis of his
being greater than the churches. I quote from one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
characteristic addresses, and one that is in many respects
excellent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Perhaps his religious nature was so broad that it could
not be compassed within the limits of any particular creed or
system of doctrines. Perhaps he saw the soul of truth so
clearly that he could not accept any one of them as a complete
and final revelation of truth. Perhaps he so clearly realized
that all religious creeds and systems have their roots in human
nature that he could look upon the Christian system as the only
deposit of truth committed to the children of men. Perhaps
his conception of Deity was so vast that he could not see all
the Divine attributes manifest in the historic Christ. Perhaps
he felt that some of the doctrines of Christianity, as they were
formulated and preached in his day, would be a hindrance
rather than a help to his religious faith, so clear was his vision
of the things which are unseen and eternal, and so close was
his relation to the Author of his being. Perhaps he felt no
need of a daysman or mediator, because he himself knew the
Lord face to face."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Milton R. Scott</span>: <i>Lincoln, Was He an
Inspired Prophet?</i>, pp. 55-57.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a measure of truth in this presentation of one side
of the case, but it is not the whole truth. Lincoln did not
possess this supposed clarity of vision of all spiritual truth.
Some things he saw clearly, but his faith and vision had each
of them marked and undeniable limitations.</p>

<p>In his widely popular and in many respects excellent oration
on Lincoln, Bishop Fowler said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let us analyze Mr. Lincoln if we are able. This task is
difficult on account of his symmetry. He was so much like a
sphere that he projected farthest in every direction. His comprehension
is to us impossible on account of his immensity, for
a man can be comprehended only by his peers" (p. 28).</p></blockquote>

<p>He found the same difficulty in estimating Grant. "It is
difficult to analyze General Grant, because he is so simple and
complete. Like Lincoln, he is like a sphere; approached from
any side he seems to project farthest toward you. Try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
divide, and each section is like all the rest. Cut him through,
and he is all the way through alike" (p. 127).</p>

<p>I do not think that this is correct concerning Grant, and it
certainly is not true concerning Lincoln. He was not a sphere;
he was angular or he was nothing.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In endeavoring to assess
his religious convictions, we are liable to encounter contradictions.
But there is a certain inconsistent consistency in
those contradictions. There are certain kinds of contradictions
which we do not encounter, and certain which, encountering,
may be interpreted in the light of certain underlying agreements.</p>

<p>For instance, the Calvinism which he inherited and heard
through his childhood and which he accepted in a kind of semi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>-fatalistic
philosophy might seem the reverse of scientific. But
the natural science which Lincoln learned from <i>Vestiges of
Creation</i>, while it would have been repudiated by every Baptist
preacher whom Lincoln ever heard in his youth, was capable
of being grafted upon that very root.</p>

<p>I suggest one more limitation in the character of Abraham
Lincoln, which had its possible relation to his hypothetical
church membership. He was possessed in marked degree of
the obstinacy of irresolution. That genial good-nature of his
had behind it stubbornness, irony, and a sullen but mighty
temper which rarely broke the bounds of self-control, but
sometimes manifested itself on very slight provocation. Just
when men thought they had discovered in Abraham Lincoln a
nose of wax which they could shape to their own liking, they
encountered in him a wholly unexpected element of passive
inertia and of active obstinacy. When he did not know what
to do, he would not do anything. It was this quality in him
which enabled him to rule a rampant Cabinet and which justified
the qualities set forth in such books as Major Putnam's
<i>Abraham Lincoln the Leader</i>, Richard Watson Gilder's <i>Lincoln
the Leader</i>, and Alonzo Rothschild's <i>Lincoln, Master of
Men</i>. It was this which enabled Herndon to write of him:
"I know Abraham Lincoln better than he knows himself....
You and I must keep the people right; God will keep
Lincoln right."</p>

<p>Those do greatly err who see in Lincoln only genial good
humor and teachableness; there was a point at which his good
humor became withering scorn or towering passion and his
gentle and tractable disposition became adamantine inertia.
His successor, Andrew Johnson, quoted as characterizing himself
the lines from Sir Walter Scott:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Come one, come all; this rock shall fly</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>From its firm base as soon as I.</i>"</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lincoln might with much more appropriateness have
quoted it of himself.</p>

<p>Mary Todd Lincoln united with the First Presbyterian
Church of Springfield on April 13, 1852, upon profession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
her faith. The church records contain no record of her dismissal,
but only the word "Deceased" without a date. She
remained a member until her death, though, after her return
to Springfield in an unhappy state of mind, she was not a very
active one. The only other Lincoln record on the books of
this church is the baptism of Thomas Lincoln&mdash;"Tad," "son
of Abraham and Mary"&mdash;on April 4, 1855. The records of
the financial secretary, not very complete, show Abraham Lincoln
to have been a pew-holder from 1852 to 1861, and he
departed for Washington with his pew rent paid to the date of
his departure. This is all that is to be learned from the church
records in Springfield.</p>

<p>Mary Todd Lincoln was a member in good and regular
standing of the Episcopal Church when she united with the
Presbyterian, but she united on profession of her faith. She
affirmed that she did not believe that she had ever previously
been converted. This statement is one of several indications
that she, and with her her husband, came into a new religious
experience after the death of Willie in Washington, as earlier
he had been profoundly impressed after the death of Eddie
in Springfield.</p>

<p>We learn through sources outside the records, but wholly
credible sources, that her uniting with the Presbyterian Church
was preceded by a revival in the church, and she and her husband
attended the revival meetings regularly. Not only so, but
many of Lincoln's associates, including Major Stuart and other
influential men of Springfield, were present almost every night
and were deeply interested. The letter of Thomas Lewis,
already cited, refers to the general expectation that Lincoln
would have united with the church with his wife. A similar
and wholly independent report comes to us<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> from Lincoln's
associates outside the church. They, also, expected him to go
in with his wife. But Lincoln was not fully persuaded. The
logic of Dr. Smith demolished all the arguments of the infidels
and did it over again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"And thrice he vanquished all his foes,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>And thrice he slew the slain.</i>"</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But doubts, though logically answered, still rose in Lincoln's
mind. On the other hand, and more important, Lincoln did
not find himself able to accept the rigid Calvinism of the
Presbyterian Church of that day. The evangelist made strong
appeals, and Lincoln was not unmoved. But he said to his
friends that "he couldn't quite see it."</p>

<p>Lincoln was a man of mighty courage when his convictions
were assured. But he was also a man of more than normal
caution. He could meet an issue which he was fully convinced
was right with all needful heroism. But he was capable of
evading an issue about which he was uncertain.</p>

<p>We know what Lincoln did just after his State Fair speech
in Springfield on October 3, 1854. He was roused "as never
before," to quote his own words, by the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise, and he came out in a four hours' speech following
Douglas, and committed himself unqualifiedly to the anti-Nebraska
program. The Abolitionists were overjoyed, and
Lovejoy wanted him to address that body that very night.
Lincoln was in a quandary. To offend the Abolitionists meant
political death, for they were now strong and growing
stronger; but, on the other hand, to become an Abolitionist
meant political death also at that stage of the fight. Herndon,
who was himself an Abolitionist, and not much given to compromise,
fully realized that Lincoln was in grave political
danger.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> With Herndon's approval, Lincoln took Bob in his
buggy and drove off out into the country till the crisis was
over.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>We know something also, though probably not the whole
truth, about Lincoln's wavering indecision with respect to his
marriage to Mary Todd. Whether he ran away from his own
wedding, as he ran away from the offer of the leadership of
the Abolition movement, and if so, whether he was sane or
insane at the time, are questions which I prefer not, at this
time, to undertake to answer. But that incident may be cited
as another reminder that Lincoln had times of great mental
uncertainty, and that at such times he sometimes did unexpected
things.</p>

<p>It is my firm conviction that, after the death of Eddie,
Lincoln was profoundly stirred in his own spiritual life; that
the arguments of Dr. Smith went far toward answering the
arguments of Paine, Volney, and his freethinking friends; that
bereavement and spiritual comfort had done their work of
grace; that the desire for a home more truly united in its
religious relations and spiritual sympathies made a strong appeal
to him; and that the atmosphere of the revival seemed to
make it easy and natural for him to enter the church with
Mrs. Lincoln. But, though a Calvinist in his early training, he
was not ready to accept Calvinism as a complete and articulated
system as presented in the Westminster Confession and
in the preaching of Dr. Smith.</p>

<p>He wavered. Whether he left town to avoid pressure to
attend the meeting of the Session at which his wife made her
application for church membership, we do not know. It is not
improbable. Certainly if his absence had been unavoidable
he could have joined at the next opportunity. I think that he
did not join because he was still in some measure of intellectual
uncertainty with reference to doctrinal matters. I am only
sorry that someone did not tell him that these were no sufficient
reasons for his declining to unite with the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be possible to carry this study further, but it is
not necessary. An explanation of Lincoln's failure to unite
with a Christian church in that time of bitter sectarianism
when to have joined one church would have made him a target
for criticism from others and when his mind was intent rather
upon the application of his Christian principles than the proclamation
of his religious opinions, is partly to be attributed to
the faults of the churches; but a portion of the explanation
is to be found also in qualities inherent in the life of Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE CONSTRUCTIVE ARGUMENT</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are ready now to undertake the difficult task of determining
with some approach to certainty the essential content
and character of Abraham Lincoln's religious belief.</p>

<p>We must not be surprised if we find ourselves unable to
construct a perfectly symmetrical and consistent confession of
faith. The material is much more abundant and explicit and
much better attested in some departments than in others. Not
only so, but we must never forget the mighty elements of contradiction
in Lincoln's personality.</p>

<p>Mediocre men have this in their favor, that it is relatively
easy to classify them. Not only may they be readily assigned
to their several occupations, and conveniently pigeon-holed as
butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers, but it is a comparatively
simple task to group them under single adjectives, as
good and bad, black and white, tall and short, fat and lean,
old and young, intelligent and stupid. The process is less easy
with really great men. There is always an admirable element
of human inconsistency in men of large mold which would be
intolerable in lesser personalities. It has been truly said that
no man becomes really great and influential who is not a good
subject for caricature. The sublime is own sister to the ridiculous.
Genius is next akin to insanity. The men who do really
great things are a perpetual puzzle to those who possess only
commonplace standards of classification. A commonplace villain
is a villain, first, last, and all the time; but a villain like
Milton's Satan, Napoleon, or the late German Kaiser is so
great a villain as to be half a hero. The two hundred seventy-six
dripping men who struggled through the surf at Malta one
stormy morning rather more than eighteen hundred years ago
and gathered shivering round the fire, were quickly classified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
for the most part, into four convenient companies, of sailors,
soldiers, passengers, and prisoners; but when one of them
shook off a viper into the fire and showed no sign of hurt, it
was quite certain that he was either a murderer or a god.
Opinions might differ and did differ as to which of the two
extremes might properly be claimed for him, but no one proposed
to find a place for him in middle ground.</p>

<p>The strength of great men lies in their possession and their
counterpoise of opposing qualities. Over against the monotonous
uniformity, the stupid consistency, of those common
people whom Lincoln said God must love because He made
so many of them, this quality displays itself as a peculiar possession
of genius. Now and then it is given to a great man
sufficiently so to subordinate the inconsistencies without which
real greatness could not exist as to incarnate some outstanding
principle of which he becomes the exponent. Abraham Lincoln
did this; and the world, or that small part of the world which
can lay claim to any considerable measure of moral discernment,
has redefined its conception of certain high qualities, its
measure of the moral significance of certain notable achievements,
in terms of his personality. This process is highly
desirable as well as inevitable; but the elements of inconsistency
are not thereby removed from the character itself.
Of him we might say:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has often been affirmed that "'Lincoln knew his Bible
better than any minister," and large claims have been made concerning
his use of it in public addresses. Mr. Lincoln did
know and use the Bible, and his style is saturated with it; but it
would be easy to exaggerate both his knowledge and use of it.</p>

<p>Prof. Daniel Kilham Dodge of the University of Illinois
examined twenty-five of Lincoln's extended and carefully prepared
addresses with this result:<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>In five speeches from 1839 to 1852 he found six Biblical
quotations, of which four were in his temperance address.</p>

<p>In his reply to Douglas in 1852 there were two Biblical
quotations, both from the Old Testament.</p>

<p>In 1856 he found one, and that most notable of all&mdash;the
"house divided against itself."</p>

<p>In his "lost speech" at Bloomington, as recorded by Whitney,
there were six Biblical quotations, four from the Old
Testament and two from the New&mdash;the largest number in any
single speech.</p>

<p>In his ten speeches in the Lincoln and Douglas debates
there were two Biblical references, besides a number of allusions
to the "house divided against itself."</p>

<p>There were no Biblical quotations in the Cooper Union
address or in the First Inaugural or in the Gettysburg address;
none in the two messages to Congress in 1861.</p>

<p>His Second Inaugural was itself a kind of leaf out of the
books of the prophets.</p>

<p>In the whole of the twenty-five speeches, there were found
twenty-two Biblical references, eight in the Old Testament and
fourteen in the New. This notwithstanding the impression of
many who knew him that Lincoln preferred the Old Testament
to the New, as recorded by Noah Brooks.</p>

<p>But this rather meager use of direct quotations and allusions
need not disappoint us. Nor does it militate against
the essentially Biblical substratum of his style. When we
come to the study of Lincoln's literary and oratorical method,
we find more striking contradictions and evolutions than we
have here. Lincoln's oratory was not of the same style at
all periods of his career, nor were his methods uniform at
any one period.</p>

<p>He was a ready stump-speaker, yet he became so cautious
while in the White House that he was timid about responding
even to a serenade without having first written out his address,
and on occasion could appear rude in declining to utter even a
simple word of greeting and appreciation, as on the night
before his address in Gettysburg, when he was very abrupt to
the company that serenaded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>He had been accustomed to large use of gesture, swinging
his great arms, and sometimes, even in the Douglas debates,
bending his knees till they almost touched the platform, and
then rising suddenly almost with a whoop, but he became very
quiet and self-restrained in his oratory.</p>

<p>He is alleged to have loved Burns more than any other poet,
yet his speeches have been searched in vain for a single quotation
from Burns. It is said that next to Burns he loved
Byron, and he is not known ever to have quoted Byron in any
speech or paper. It is said that his favorite Shakspeare play
was <i>Richard III.</i>, but his Shakspeare quotations are from
<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Lear</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>; and there is
one allusion to Falstaff.</p>

<p>Besides Shakspeare, whom he quoted next to the Bible,
his literary allusions are to T. H. Bayley, Dickens, Robert
Herrick, Pope and Scott, and they are not numerous. The
total number of his quotations, as listed by Professor Dodge,
including Shakspeare, but not including the Bible, is thirty.</p>

<p>What is more surprising, Lincoln was known as a great
story teller. But his addresses contain hardly a single anecdote.
He told stories in jury trials and to illustrate points in
conversation, but he rarely told them in his addresses.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>No man who knew Lincoln intimately studied him so long,
so industriously, or, in spite of many limitations, so appreciatively,
as William H. Herndon. He was a profound believer
in the mental and spiritual evolution of Lincoln.</p>

<p>In 1887, while Herndon, after many years of interruption,
began again the preparation of his <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, he had an
extended correspondence, partly from Springfield, and partly
from Greencastle, Indiana, where Mr. Jesse W. Weik was at
work with him on his book, and with a Boston sculptor, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Truman H. Bartlett, who was planning a statue of Lincoln.
Herndon's letters went more and more into detail as the correspondence
proceeded, and he gave in some respects the very
best affirmation of the development of Lincoln on the higher
side of his nature that Herndon wrote at any time.</p>

<p>Herndon seemed to have some apprehension that a study
of photographs and life-masks and other evidences of the
physical appearance of Lincoln would not reveal the man himself.
He said that a person studying his physical nature would
say "that his physical nature was low, coarse, and not high
and fine." Before he sent this letter he re-read it, and inserted
the word "comparatively" before "low." Mr. Bartlett asked
him further about this, and Herndon went into detail as to
Lincoln's body. "His blood ran slowly. He was of a low or
slow mechanical power, within him. I did not intend to say
that Lincoln's organization was a low, animal organization.
What I meant to say was that it was a slow-working machine.
Lincoln's flesh was coarse, pimply, dry, hard, harsh; color
of his flesh saffron brown; no blood seemingly in it; flesh
wrinkled."</p>

<p>Mr. Bartlett apparently inquired whether the abnormal
qualities of frontier life produced these effects, and whether
Herndon had known other men of the Lincoln type. Apparently
he alluded to the presence of malaria and the large
use of pork in frontier diet.</p>

<p>Herndon did not accept the pork and malaria theories. He
said that all such theories must give way to facts, and he dealt
with facts. The men of the frontier had the best meat in
the world, "venison, bear, turkey, and of course some hog."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You ask me if I ever saw in this great wild west many
men of Lincoln's type, and to which I answer, Yes. The first
settlers of central and southern Illinois were men of that type.
They came from the limestone regions of Virginia, Kentucky,
and Tennessee, and were men of giant strength, physical force,
and by nature mentally strong. They were original, were individualists.
The strong alone from 1818 to 1830 could get
here, and the strong alone could survive here.... No one
was like Lincoln, and yet many were of his type.... He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
was, as you say, 'a man of extraordinary contrasts.' You
would not look for a well-rounded man in such a description."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln was, then, as Herndon saw him, and as the world
must see him, a legitimate product of his environment. Herndon
had read Buckle and Spencer and Darwin, and was a
thoroughgoing believer in evolution, as was Lincoln, from a
far narrower reading, but a very thoughtful study of <i>Vestiges
of Creation</i>.</p>

<p>Physically, Lincoln was akin to the strong pioneers of
early Illinois, and it was not difficult to find each several trait
of Lincoln reduplicated in many of them. But Lincoln himself
was never duplicated. He was a product of his environment,
but he was also an evolution which in terms of an individual
personality went beyond environment, and was still going forward
when death came to him.</p>

<p>This evolution of Lincoln, the spiritual Lincoln, as portrayed
in these letters to a sculptor, who must not be permitted
to forget, if he was in danger of forgetting, that the real man
Lincoln had in him more than his bodily measurements could
portray, is one of the most suggestive studies disclosed by
Herndon, and it is sound, both as approached from the standpoint
of science, and as considered in the personal study of
Lincoln in his growth from year to year.</p>

<p>Like St. Paul, Lincoln had a warfare in his members. He
was an embodiment of forces mutually antagonistic. He
would not have been the man he was had either of them been
lacking, and the growth of either at the total expense of the
other would have given us a man abnormal, which Mr. Lincoln
came perilously near to being. But his real development was
mental and spiritual.</p>

<p>In another place St. Paul says that "The first man is of
the earth, earthy, and the second man is from heaven." It
has been assumed without due warrant that what he had in
mind was a contrast between Adam and Christ, and this view
is strengthened by the intrusion of the words "the Lord" in
the authorized English text. But it is quite possible that St.
Paul, even if Adam and Christ were a part of his contrast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
had really in mind the evolution of any man's life; he being
himself in his bodily nature the first man and in the birth and
growth of his higher nature the second and contrasting man.
"First is that which is natural, and after, that which is
spiritual."</p>

<p>This was Herndon's thought of Lincoln, as disclosed in
these letters,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and it is true of Lincoln. Lincoln was more
than an embodiment of contrasts; the solar system is that, and
it is more. In the solar system the opposing forces do not
neutralize each other, but together hold the earth and planets
in their orbits. So it was with Lincoln. But with him the
higher and nobler forces became increasingly dominant.</p>

<p>Herndon resented it when anyone said that Lincoln had
died at the right time. He believed that, great as Lincoln was,
his nobler qualities had not yet come to their full maturity,
and that a longer-lived Lincoln would have been an even
nobler Lincoln. Here are some of the things he says of him
in these letters:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I said to you once that Mr. Lincoln had not arrived at
maturity in 1865, and I say so now. His blood ran slowly&mdash;had
low or slow circulation and consequently a slow build-up.
As he had a slow build-up, so he had a slow development; he
grew up like the forest oak, tough, solid, knotty, gnarled,
standing out with power against the storm, and almost defying
the lightning. Hence I conclude that he had not arrived at his
highest development in 1865.... The convolutions of his
brain were long; they did not snap off quickly like a short,
thick man's brain.... The enduring power of Mr. Lincoln's
thought and brain was wonderful. He could sit and
think without food or rest longer than any man I ever saw."</p></blockquote>

<p>He goes into detail concerning Mr. Lincoln's bodily
lethargy and its effect on body and mind, the sluggishness of
all his functions, and affirms that this must be taken into account
in any right estimate of the man; but that steadily, and
the more surely because slowly, his mind and soul developed
and became more and more dominant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His flesh looked dry and leathery, tough and everlasting;
his eyes were small and gray; head small and forehead receding;
but when this great man was moved by some great and
good feeling, by some idea of Liberty, or Justice, or Right,
then he seemed an inspired man. It was just then that Lincoln's
nature was beautiful, and in complete harmony with
the laws of the Great Eternal. I have seen him in this inspired
condition, and thought he was molded in the Spirit's
best mold. Lincoln was a great man, a good man, and a pure
man; and beneath his rough bodily exterior, Nature wove her
fine network of nerve.... Lincoln was a gloomy man at
one moment and a joyous man the next; he was conscious
that a terrible fate awaited him. He said to me, 'I cannot help
but believe that I shall meet with some terrible end.' This idea
seized him and made him gloomy. At times his better nature
would get the mastery of him, and he would be happy till the
shadow of his fate flitted before him. In philosophy Lincoln
was a fatalist.... In my poor opinion, Lincoln had not
arrived, when he was assassinated, at the meridian of his intellectual
power.... Were you to read his early speeches
thoroughly you would see his then coarse nature. He gradually
rose up, more spiritualistic. This is one of the reasons
why I say that Lincoln was not fully developed in mind at the
last. When a great Boston man said, 'Lincoln died at the
right time,' he did not know what he was talking about."</p></blockquote>

<p>In these and like paragraphs Herndon testified to the
mental and spiritual evolution of Lincoln; and he was probably
correct when he opined that that evolution was still in
process, and that Lincoln was, up to the very hour of his
death, a growing man in all that meant most to America and
the world.</p>

<p>The religion of Abraham Lincoln was part and parcel of
his life; and his life was an evolution whose successive stages
can be measured with reasonable certainty. Not only did his
religious convictions develop and broaden under the stimuli of
Lincoln's constantly broadening intellectual and spiritual environment,
but they broadened in the growth of his own
personality.</p>

<p>There was an evolution in his apprehension of the ethical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
implications of public office. The Lincoln who re-entered
politics after the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was a
changed man from the Lincoln who, with the other members
of the "Long Nine," earned by political log-rolling the severe
but not wholly unmerited name applied to them by one of
Illinois' best governors, "spared monuments of popular
wrath." That Lincoln did not in this earlier period commit
any personally dishonorable act is not an argument against
the theory here advocated. He had, in his later political career,
a far higher ideal of political honor, a greatly nobler conception
of the dignity of public office&mdash;which he always sought&mdash;as a
field of popular service. His political career was an evolution,
and it developed nobler characteristics than that which characterized
his earlier political life.</p>

<p>Lincoln's emancipation policy was an evolution. The successive
stages of that policy were worthily set forth by Paul
Selby in an address before the Historical Society of Chicago.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
There never was a time when Abraham Lincoln did not believe
slavery to be wrong, but there was a time when he was not an
Abolitionist. The moral aspect of the slavery question grew
in his mind and conscience till he promised his God to free
the slaves.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, September 7, 1862, a public meeting
was held in Bryan Hall, Chicago, to urge upon the President
the desire of Christian people that he should free the slaves.
A petition was circulated, and was signed by all the Congregational
and nearly all the Methodist and Baptist ministers of
that city, courteously requesting the President to give the
matter his earnest attention. The petition was sent to Washington
by the hand of Rev. William W. Patton and Rev. John
Dempster, who met the President by appointment on Saturday
afternoon, September 13, the interview being arranged by
Hon. Gideon Welles.</p>

<p>The story of that meeting has often been told in part, with
undue emphasis upon Mr. Lincoln's statement then made that
if God had a message for him on this subject He would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
more likely to communicate it directly to Mr. Lincoln than to
others for him. The latest book to misuse this incident is one
just from the press in Great Britain, the <i>Short Life of Lincoln</i>,
by Hon. Ralph Shirley, who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some of the ministers in this deputation even went so
far as to assure him that they had authority in God's name to
command him to emancipate the slaves."</p></blockquote>

<p>Inasmuch as there were but two of the ministers, and
neither of them assumed any such authority to speak the mind
of God, such statements ought to cease, especially as the true
story, from which all these accounts are garbled, is available
for inspection in the files of the Maryland Historical Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln did say to them that he hoped it would not
appear irreverent in him to say that if God were to reveal
this duty of his to others, it was probable that He would
reveal it also directly to Mr. Lincoln. At the beginning of
the interview he was guarded; but as he found common ground
with his visitors, he threw first one leg and then the other over
the arm of his chair, and talked to them with the utmost freedom,
and asked them concerning the opinion of ministers and
churches, and assured them that he desired to know the will
of God, and whatever seemed to him to be God's will he
would do.</p>

<p>The next week occurred the battle of Antietam, and on
Saturday, September 20, exactly a week after his interview
with the Chicago ministers, Mr. Lincoln called the Cabinet
together and read to them the Emancipation Proclamation,
which was signed and published on the following Monday.
We know now that Lincoln had promised God that if that
battle resulted in the success of the Union cause he would
issue the proclamation. We also know that the meeting with
the Chicago ministers was very timely, and gave him an added
assurance of moral support from the churches, if not added
confidence in the help of God.</p>

<p>Some time after, Joseph Medill, editor of the Chicago
<i>Tribune</i>, returning from Washington, said, "Secretary Stan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>ton
told me to say to those Chicago clergymen who waited
on the President about the Proclamation of Emancipation, that
their interview finished the business. After that there was no
manifestation of doubt or talk of delay. Mr. Lincoln's mind
was fully made up."&mdash;<i>Proceedings of the Maryland Historical
Society, Baltimore</i>, 1888.</p>

<p>Lincoln's literary style was an evolution.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> His spread-eagle
stump-speeches, with their florid rhetoric and grandiloquent
figures of speech evolved into the calm, dignified, and
forceful English of his maturer years.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> An able monograph
in which this evolution is traced is cited elsewhere in this
volume.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> That change of style was the outward and visible
sign of an inward and spiritual as well as intellectual grace.</p>

<p>In like manner Lincoln's religion was an evolution, both in
its intellectual and its spiritual qualities. Up to the time of his
residence in New Salem he had heard only the dogmatic sectarianism
of unlettered preachers, proclaiming a creed which
furnished him certain lifelong tenets but which as a whole he
could not accept. At New Salem he read the negative arguments
which confuted the dogmas he had heard, and perhaps
unwittingly made room for a more intelligent faith.</p>

<p>He was deeply impressed by the argument of Dr. Smith in
his <i>The Christian's Defence</i>. It was the first time he had
heard the Christian apologetic rationally presented, and it
made a lasting impression upon him without, however, fully
satisfying him. He was, however, a much more religious man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
when he left Springfield than he was when he came to it,
whether he knew it or not.</p>

<p>The solemn responsibilities of his office, the daily contemplation
of death as it menaced him and came into the homes
of the people of his country, the profound conviction that God
was working His infinite purpose through the war, and through
the human agency of Lincoln himself, took hold of the deepest
impulses of his nature, and became the controlling forces of
his policy.</p>

<p>Lincoln was no theologian, but I do not find any authority
for the statement of Mr. Binns that Lincoln said, "the more a
man knew of theology, the farther he got away from the
Spirit of Christ." It is possible, of course, for a man to learn
theology as an intellectual system and to have little religion as
a spiritual experience, and to lose that little in the process of his
logical subtleties: but Lincoln was too just a man to make so
sweeping and unjust an affirmation of something of which he
would certainly have admitted he knew very little.</p>

<p>The rock-bottom foundation of Abraham Lincoln's
religious faith was the ultra-Calvinism of his boyhood. He
was reared a Predestinarian Baptist; and while he never
became a Baptist he never ceased to be a Predestinarian. To
this he added a strong rationalistic tendency, inherent in his
nature, and strengthened by his study of Paine and Volney.
This also he never wholly outgrew. As a lawyer who was not
well read, pleading before juries that cared little for the letter
of the law, he was accustomed to reduce his cases to simple
principles of elementary justice, and to rest all upon these
principles. This habit of thought and practice he applied also
to his theology. His early recollection of the epitaph of
Johnny Kongapod was nothing less than the application of the
Golden Rule to theology&mdash;the assurance of an eternal justice
throned in heaven and intelligible on earth.</p>

<p>Thus, when he argued in favor of universal salvation he
did it upon the basis of the old Calvinistic theology with which
he had been familiar all his life. If God was, indeed, absolute
sovereign, and as good as He was great, and willed not that
any should perish, then no one could finally perish. Universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
salvation became logically and ethically compulsory. The
Christ who tasted death for every man, did so as the necessary
means to the efficiency of a plan of salvation whereby the curse
of the fall was fully offset by the sacrifice of Christ, at the
instance of the sovereign will of God. As in Adam all died,
even so in Christ were all made alive. His theory of universal
salvation was the logical expression of his determinism, influenced
by his rationalism and confirmed by his appeal to a
justice that would not accept a fall more universal than the
atonement of Christ. This was not because Lincoln approached
the theme from the direction of the grace of Christ,
but of the irresistibility of a divine decree. He profoundly
believed himself an instrument of the divine will, believing that
will to be right, and creation's final law.</p>

<p>If it were asked, where in such a system as his he found a
place for the forgiveness of sins, the answer would be first
that he had no system, and secondly that he found no place
for the doctrine; but it would then be necessary to add that he
found the doctrine, nevertheless. He had no system. He
thought without logical method. But his thinking was in right
lines. He followed simple paths, "blazed" through technicalities
and in quite thorough disregard of them. As his office
desk was in confusion, and he kept a package marked, "When
you don't find it anywhere else, look here," so he had in his
thinking a parcel of unassorted first principles to which he
recurred when he needed them. Forgiveness and law were to
him two unreconciled postulates; but law he had to assume,
even though he denied forgiveness. But if he did not admit
belief in forgiveness, he did believe in mercy, for he himself
was merciful, and he believed that he would be merciful to
God if he were God and God were man. Stanton could argue
him down as to the necessity for shooting a soldier who slept on
duty, but Lincoln injected an intuitive, and from Stanton's
point of view, an unreasonable and a certainly unarticulated,
element of mercy that forbade the killing of this particular
boy.</p>

<p>His theory of governmental forgiveness was as irreconcilable
with his theory of military discipline as his theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
divine mercy was with his system of inexorable law. He did
not harmonize the contradictions: he was merciful, and let his
system take the consequences, and he believed in a divine
mercy while holding a theory with which the exercise of
mercy was irreconcilable.</p>

<p>To such a mind as that of Abraham Lincoln, it was not
necessary to prove the fact of immortality. If God possessed
immortality and intended it for man, then God would make
His decree effective in man. Adam's fall could not hopelessly
lose to man what God designed; and, whether he accepted for
himself or not the theory of the fall and of redemption, he
accepted both in meeting an argument which by reason of the
fall could have deprived man of his birthright of immortality.
He believed in the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>Did he harmonize that doctrine with the rest of his creed?
Probably not. He was no theologian, in the strict and formal
sense, no logician. He reasoned on the basis of very simple
and elementary principles, whose lines of direction were determined
by the early Calvinistic preaching to which he listened,
the rationalistic method which he learned from Paine, and his
simple sense of justice and right.</p>

<p>His was not wholly an optimistic faith. He knew that man
was sinful and sad and that "the spirit of mortal" had little
occasion for pride; but he believed in an eternal justice and
an unconquerable goodness, regnant above the perplexities and
contradictions of this life, and triumphant in the life everlasting.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln believed in God. Save in his moments
of deepest gloom when everything turned black, he appears
never seriously to have questioned this fundamental article
of belief. It is not easy to see how he could have done so.
His idea of causation forbade it, and, what was more, his
profound supernaturalism affirmed it as incontrovertible. This
element of supernaturalism went the full length of orthodox
preaching, as Lincoln heard it and accepted it. It was in accord
with the teachings both of the Baptists, whom he heard
in Indiana and rural Illinois, and the Presbyterians, to whom
he listened in Springfield and in Washington. In a great God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
a mighty Creator, a Sovereign Ruler, he was taught to believe
by all the forms of Calvinism to which throughout his life he
listened, and it was in full essential accord with his own native
tendency. His supernaturalism was not only ultra-orthodox;
it went the full length of current superstition. The frontiersman
of that day had superstition wrought into him by the vastness
of the wilderness, the solemnity of the immeasurable
forest and plain, and the insignificance of man; the haunting
tales of savagery and witchcraft; the presence in every frontier
community of some person supposed to be possessed of second
sight or other supernatural qualities. The rationalism of his
mature years modified but did not in any degree eradicate his
supernaturalism.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Paine and Volney, whose
works he read, were far from being atheists. Thomas Paine,
whatever he denied, believed as strongly as Peter Cartwright
or James Smith in a personal God. So far as we know,
Lincoln was never under any strong influence that might have
made him an atheist, his doubts and questionings were all
within the sphere of an expressed or implicit theism.</p>

<p>The names by which Lincoln referred to God are many and
suggestive. The following is a partial list:<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Almighty, Almighty Architect, Almighty Arm, Almighty
Father, Almighty God, Almighty Hand, Almighty Power,
Almighty Ruler of Nations, Creator, Disposer, Divine Author,
Divine Being, Divine Majesty, Divine Providence, Divine
Will, Eternal God, Father, Father in Heaven, Father of
Mercies, God, God Almighty, God of Battles, God of Hosts,
God of Nations, Governor, Heavenly Father, Higher Being,
Higher Power, Holy Spirit, Judge, Lord, Maker, Maker of
the Universe, Master, Most High, Most High God, Omniscient
Mind, Power, Providence, Ruler of the Universe, Supreme
Being.</p>

<p>Lincoln believed in the Bible. I am not sure that he
accepted the whole content of the positive arguments set forth
so cogently by his pastor, Dr. Smith. When he called this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
argument "unanswerable," it need not imply that his every
doubt was satisfied, his every misgiving reassured. It is entirely
possible that there lingered in his mind some vestiges of
what he had read in writers opposed to the doctrine of the inspiration
of the Scriptures as it was then taught; indeed, that
doctrine in the form in which it was currently stated was not
one by which a modern man's orthodoxy ought to be tested.
But he read the Bible, honored it, quoted it freely, and it became
so much a part of him as visibly and permanently to give
shape to his literary style and to his habits of thought. When
Mrs. Speed presented him an Oxford Bible in 1841, he declared
his intention to read it regularly, believing it to be "the best
cure for the blues"; and he kept and loved and constantly used
his mother's Bible. How he would have defined his theory of
its transmission and of the relation of its divine and human elements
we do not know, and we need not be too curious to
inquire. It is more than possible that Mr. Lincoln never made
this definition in his own mind. His attitude toward the Bible
was a thoroughly practical one. We do not know that he ever
heard Coleridge's pragmatic affirmation, but we have every
reason to believe that he would have accepted it, namely, that
he valued the Bible because "it finds me as no other book."</p>

<p>Concerning his opinion of Jesus Christ our material for
constructive hypothesis is exceedingly scanty.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Herndon says
he does not believe the name of Jesus can be found in any of
Lincoln's authentic writings. I have found it in his writings
but I must confess that I have not found it frequently in any
which I count to be certainly genuine.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> There are, however,
a number of references to Jesus Christ in his writings and published
addresses, and they are both positive and reverent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>On July 4, 1864, the colored people of Baltimore presented
him a beautiful copy of the Bible of the usual pulpit
size, bound in violet-colored velvet. The corners were bands
of solid gold and there was a thick plate of gold upon the
cover, bearing this inscription:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
the friend of universal freedom. From the loyal colored
people of Baltimore, as a token of respect and gratitude.
Baltimore, July 4, 1864."</p></blockquote>

<p>In accepting this gift, which was presented in person by a
committee of five, the President said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In regard to this great book, I have only to say it is the
best gift which God has ever given man. All the good from
the Saviour of the world is communicated to us through this
book."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carpenter</span>: <i>Six Months in the White House</i>, p. 199;
also <span class="smcap">Nicolay</span> and <span class="smcap">Hay</span>: <i>Works of Lincoln</i>, twelve volume
edition, X, 217-18.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such references as this show to us the instinctive place
which he accorded Jesus Christ in his own unpremeditated
thinking. This was the best thing he had to say about the
Bible, that through it alone we have knowledge of the Saviour
of the world.</p>

<p>Herndon tells us that Lincoln ridiculed the doctrine of the
virgin birth of Jesus. If this is true, I am very sorry. But
Abraham Lincoln's faith in Christ did not depend wholly or
even primarily upon his interpretation of the mystery of our
Lord's birth. I approach a discussion of this question with
some hesitation, for it is one which, as related to Lincoln we
do not know very much about, but it is a subject which we are
not free to pass over in silence.</p>

<p>It is a sad fact that the argument for the divinity of our
Lord Jesus Christ should ever have been based on the mystery
of his birth. Not thus does the New Testament establish the
doctrine of his divinity. The wonderful story of the birth of
Jesus is told in two places only,&mdash;in the introduction to the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Gospels of Matthew and Luke, and these are the very two that
contain genealogies tracing his descent through Joseph. The
theory that one of these gives the family tree of Mary is unsupported
by any evidence. So far as we know, Jesus never
referred to the mystery of his birth, or attached any importance
to it. His two brothers, James and Jude, each wrote a book
which we have in the New Testament, and there is no reference
in either of them to this doctrine. Peter preached his
mighty sermons at Pentecost and afterwards, proclaiming the
faith on which the Church was established, and he grounded
his argument for the divinity of Jesus not upon his birth, but
upon his resurrection from the dead. Paul preached the gospel
of Christ throughout the Roman world, and neither in any
recorded sermon nor in any letter did he make any reference
to that dogma. Mark, earliest of the gospels, and for we know
not how long a period the only one, is silent as to the birth of
Jesus; and John, the most definitely spiritual of them all,
begins and concludes his profound philosophy of the person
of Christ without a word concerning the manner of his birth.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, a wholly unwarranted dogmatism which
grounds the divinity of Jesus in a question of the domestic
relations of Joseph and Mary. Jesus Christ is to be accepted
for what He was and is, not for some opinion as to how He
became what He was.</p>

<p>We do not know whether Abraham Lincoln ever considered
the question of the birth of Christ in any personal thought he
may have had concerning his own birth. We may not forget,
however, that if Herndon is right, Lincoln lived and died without
knowing all the facts about his own mother which later
research has made certain. The marriage certificate of his
parents was recorded in another county than that in which he
supposed it would have been recorded, and he appears never
to have been certain that he himself was begotten in lawful
wedlock. We know that Nancy Hanks and Thomas Lincoln
were married a year before the birth of their eldest daughter,
who was older than Abraham Lincoln, but he is believed not
to have known that.</p>

<p>What then? Should a man in 1860 or 1864 refuse to vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
for Abraham Lincoln because he did not feel certain when or
whether his parents were married?</p>

<p>The man who said, "I believe in Abraham Lincoln," did
not commonly have in mind any question of his parentage, but
believed in his integrity, his patriotism, his moral leadership.
Even so the man who believes in Jesus Christ may believe in
Him without ever asking, much less ever answering, any
dubitable question in metaphysics.</p>

<p>Scant as are the references to Jesus in the authentic utterances
of Abraham Lincoln, they do not seem to me unimportant.
They testify to a faith that was valid as far as it
went. They manifest a spirit which is fundamentally
Christian.</p>

<p>Unable to define his own views in terms that would have
been acceptable to those who believed themselves the rightful
guardians of orthodoxy in his day, it is not surprising that
Lincoln was guarded in his references to a dogma which might
have involved him in greater difficulties than he was prepared
to meet. It was true in that day unhappily as it was in the
days of Paul, "Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and
strife; and some also of good-will." It is occasion for profound
sorrow that Christ has been so preached as that men
have sometimes found it difficult to confess their faith in Him
without provoking strife and envy.</p>

<p>That Lincoln was unwilling to make his doubt the occasion
of dogmatic negation is evident from one or more of the
acquaintances of Lincoln, whom Herndon interviewed in an
effort to adduce testimony against his faith, and whom Lamon
quoted in that part of his book in which he made his attack
upon the religion of Lincoln. The following from I. W. Keys,
the man who loaned to him <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>, is interesting
in itself and especially interesting in its relation to the group
of testimonies which these two men assembled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In my intercourse with Mr. Lincoln, I learned that he
believed in a Creator of all things, who had neither beginning
nor end, and, possessing all power and wisdom, established a
principle, in obedience to which worlds move, and are upheld,
and animal and vegetable life come into existence. A reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
he gave for his belief was that, in view of the order and harmony
of all nature which we behold, it would have been
created and arranged by some great thinking power. As to
the Christian theory, that Christ is God, or equal to the
Creator, he said that it had better be taken for granted; for,
by the test of reason, we might become infidels on that subject,
for evidence of Christ's divinity came to us in a somewhat
doubtful shape; but that the system of Christianity was an
ingenious one at least, and perhaps was calculated to do good."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>:
<i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 490.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emphatic proof of Mr. Lincoln's faith is to be found in
the positive declaration of the two men who have done most
to destroy the world's confidence in it, Lamon and Herndon.
In Lamon's later book of <i>Reminiscences</i>, he did much to counteract
the harsh and to my mind incorrect impression given in
his earlier book. But even in that book he affirmed that while
Lincoln rejected the New Testament as a book of divine
authority, he accepted its precepts as binding upon him and
was a believer in the supernatural even to credulity (p. 503,
504).</p>

<p>In that same work Herndon set forth that Lincoln was a
firm believer in God and attempted, as he said, "to put at rest
forever the charge that Mr. Lincoln was an atheist." He declared,
however, that Lincoln did not believe in a special creation,
but in an "evolution under law"; not in special revelation,
"but in miracles under law"; and that "all things both
matter and mind were governed by laws universal, absolute,
and eternal" (p. 494).</p>

<p>To this Herndon gives even more emphatic testimony in
his own book. It must then be remembered that while in the
loose nomenclature of these authors Mr. Lincoln was an "infidel"
it is these same authors that assure us, as Lamon does,
that "his theological opinions were substantially those expounded
by Theodore Parker."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
p. 486.</p>

<p>The question whether Lincoln's views underwent any substantial
change after leaving Springfield, has been answered
in the negative by John G. Nicolay, his private secretary at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the White House; who affirmed that "Mr. Lincoln did not,
to my knowledge, in any way change his religious views,
opinions, or beliefs, from the time he left Springfield to the
day of his death."</p>

<p>This probably is correct. Mr. Lincoln was not conscious of
any radical change; but Mrs. Lincoln noticed a change in him
after Willie's death, which grew more pronounced after his
visit to Gettysburg, and his own faith, while undergoing no
sudden and radical transformation, manifests a consistent
evolution.</p>

<p>But we are not sure how much Mr. Nicolay believed Lincoln's
views to have been in need of change. He said in
another place:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Benevolence and forgiveness were the very basis of his
character. His nature was deeply religious, but he belonged to
no denomination; he had faith in the eternal justice and
boundless mercy of Providence, and made the Golden Rule of
Christ his practical creed."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John G. Nicolay</span>, in article
"Abraham Lincoln" in <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, ninth edition,
XIV, 662.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln believed in divine destiny. He could hardly have
believed otherwise. The preaching to which he listened was
such as to make it all but impossible for him to hold any other
views. He believed so strongly that his own life was under
divine guidance that Lamon and Herndon speak of it in a
thinly veiled scorn as though it were in Lincoln's mind a mark
of conscious superiority. Whether it was such a mark or not
does not now concern us. Lincoln believed in divine guidance.
He had faith in prayer and his practice of prayer is attested by
many and credible witnesses. A man of his temperament and
training and sense of responsibility could not well have been
kept from praying. Prayer was a necessary part of his life.</p>

<p>Lincoln not only had faith in prayer considered as a means
of obtaining results from God; he believed in it as establishing
a relation with God, a covenant relation, such as Abraham of
old established. If such a faith seems inconsistent with any
other elements in the faith or doubt of Abraham Lincoln, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the inconsistency must stand, for he did not hold his views
in entire consistency. In no respect does this faith in the
covenant relation emerge more strongly than in connection
with the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation. Fortunately,
the evidence here is incontestable. The Proclamation
immediately became historic. Lincoln had to autograph many
copies to be sold at sanitary fairs&mdash;copies which now sell at
one thousand dollars each. Every incident relating to the
event became of immediate interest; and members of the Cabinet
had to group themselves for Carpenter's historic painting,
of which he has left so valuable a literary monument in his
<i>Six Months in the White House</i>. The members of the Cabinet
had no time to invent or imagine a set of incidents mythical in
character, for each of them had to describe many times, and
immediately, the circumstances which attended the reading of
the Proclamation to the Cabinet on Monday, September 22,
1862.</p>

<p>This is the important and incontestable fact, that Lincoln
did not bring the Proclamation to the Cabinet for discussion,
except as to minor details. He had already determined to
issue it. He had promised God that he would do so.</p>

<p>This was the statement which profoundly impressed the
members of the Cabinet,&mdash;the President told them that he had
already promised God that he would free the slaves.</p>

<p>The Diary of Gideon Welles was first published in full in
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1909, portions of it having earlier appeared
in the Century; but it was written day by day as the
events occurred. His record for Monday, September 22, 1862,
begins thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have a special Cabinet meeting. The subject was the
Proclamation concerning emancipating slaves after a certain
date in States that should then be in rebellion. For several
weeks the subject has been suspended, but, the President says,
never lost sight of. When the subject was submitted in
August, and indeed in taking it up, the President stated that
the matter was finally decided, but that he felt it to be due to
us to make us acquainted with the fact and invite criticism of
the Proclamation. There were some differences in the Cabi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>net,
but he had formed his own conclusions, and made his own
decisions. He had, he said, made a vow, a covenant, that if
God gave us the victory in the approaching battle (which had
just been fought) he would consider it his duty to move forward
in the cause of emancipation. We might think it strange,
he said, but there were times when he felt uncertain how to
act; that he had in this way submitted the disposal of matters
when the way was not clear to his mind what he should do.
God had decided this question in favor of the slave. He was
satisfied it was right&mdash;was confirmed and strengthened in his
action by the vow and its results; his mind was fixed, his decision
made; but he wished his paper announcing his course
to be as correct in terms as it could be made without any attempt
to change his determination. For that was fixed."&mdash;"The
Diary of Gideon Welles," <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, 1909,
p. 369.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have no present concern with the question whether
Lincoln's method of determining the divine will was a reasonable
method, or wholly consistent with some of his own questions
and doubts; what concerns us is that the President invited
no discussion of the Proclamation in its essential elements; any
disposition which any of the members of the Cabinet might
have felt to discuss the instrument itself or seek to dissuade
the President from issuing it was stopped by his quiet and
emphatic declaration that he had made a covenant with God,
and must keep his vow; and that he was strengthened in his
own conviction that the Proclamation was in accord with the
will of God.</p>

<p>We must not pass lightly over the religious aspects of the
Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln had submitted his first
draft of the Proclamation to the Cabinet on Tuesday, July
22, 1862, and it met with strong opposition. Only two members
of the Cabinet favored it; Seward and Chase were
strongly against it and the others thought it inopportune.
With the memory of this opposition, which in July had practically
voted the President down, Mr. Lincoln brought the
matter again on September 22, not for discussion, for as he
said he knew the view already of every member of the Cabinet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
but he had promised God that he would do this thing. That
very night Secretary Chase wrote in his diary an account of
the meeting, which is condensed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<i>Monday, September 22, 1862.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"To Department about nine. State Department messenger
came with notice to heads of Departments to meet at
twelve. Received sundry callers. Went to White House. All
the members of the Cabinet were in attendance. There was
some general talk, and the President mentioned that Artemus
Ward had sent him his book. Proposed to read a chapter
which he thought very funny. Read it, and seemed to enjoy
it very much.</p>

<p>"The President then took a graver tone, and said,
'Gentlemen: I have, as you are aware, thought a great deal
about the relation of this war to slavery; and you all remember
that, several weeks ago, I read to you an order I had prepared
on this subject, which, on account of objections made by some
of you, was not issued. Ever since then my mind has been
much occupied with this subject, and I have thought, all along,
that the time for acting on it might probably come. I think
the time has come now. I wish it was a better time. I wish
that we were in a better condition. The action of the army
against the Rebels has not been quite what I should best like.
But they have been driven out of Maryland, and Pennsylvania
is no longer in danger of invasion. When the Rebel Army
was at Frederick, I determined, as soon as it should be driven
out of Maryland, to issue a Proclamation of Emancipation,
such as I thought most likely to be useful. I said nothing to
anyone, but I made the promise to myself, and [hesitating a
little] to my Maker. The Rebel Army is now driven out, and
I am going to fulfill that promise. I have got you together
to hear what I have written down. I do not wish your advice
about the main matter, for that I have determined for myself.
This, I say, without intending anything but respect for any
one of you. But I already know the views of each on this
question. They have been heretofore expressed, and I have
considered them as thoroughly and carefully as I can. What
I have written is that which my reflections have determined me
to say. If there is anything in the expressions I use, or in any
minor matter, which any one of you thinks had best be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
changed I shall be glad to receive the suggestions. One other
observation I will make. I know very well that many others
might, in this matter as in others, do better than I can; and
if I was satisfied that the public confidence was more fully
possessed by any one of them than by me, and knew of any
constitutional way in which he could be put in my place, he
should have it. I would gladly yield it to him. But though
I believe that I have not so much of the confidence of the
people as I had some time since, I do not know that, all things
considered, any other person has more; and however this may
be, there is no way in which I can have any other man put
where I am. I am here; I must do the best I can, and bear
the responsibility of taking the course which I feel I ought to
take.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warden</span>: <i>Life of S. P. Chase</i>, pp. 481-82, quoted in
Nicolay and Hay, VI, 159-60.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the diaries of Secretaries Welles and Chase we have
incontrovertible testimony. The two records were made independently
and on that very night, and were not published for
years afterward. There was no possible collusion or reshaping
of the testimony in the light of subsequent events, no time for
imagination to play any part in enlarging upon the incident.
The President recognized that the time was not wholly propitious,
that a majority of the Cabinet probably would not be
disposed to adopt his Proclamation if put to vote, that the
people's support of the administration was wavering and unpredicable
and none too certain to approve this measure.
Under these conditions it is impossible to consider the Emancipation
Proclamation solely from the standpoint either of
political expediency or of military necessity. The fact which
silenced all opposition in the Cabinet was the President's
solemn statement that he had made a covenant with God, and
that he must keep it.</p>

<p>There is a sense in which the solemnity is heightened by
the grotesque incident of the chapter from Artemus Ward
read at the beginning. There is an aspect in which the sublimity
of that Cabinet meeting's ending is heightened by the ridiculousness
of its beginning. In any event, it shows that the
mind of Abraham Lincoln that morning was in what for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
was a thoroughly healthy condition. However incongruous it
might have been for another man to begin so solemn a meeting
with a chapter from Artemus Ward, it was a mark of sanity,
of thorough normal psychology, when done by Abraham Lincoln.
It showed that the moral overstrain was finding its
relief from excessive tension in what for Lincoln was an entirely
normal way.</p>

<p>As before stated, these two contemporary accounts by
Welles and Chase, though made at the time, were not published
until years afterward; but there was another publication that
was virtually contemporary. Frank B. Carpenter, the artist,
began almost immediately his noted painting of the signing of
the Emancipation Proclamation, and in the course of his six
months in the White House had long and repeated interviews
with all members of the Cabinet, and talked with them about
every incident connected with that event. He published his
account in his book in 1866, while all the members of the Cabinet
were living, and, so far as known, was never objected to or
proposed to be modified by any member of the Cabinet. According
to his statement, Lincoln told the Cabinet that he
had promised God that he would do this, uttering the last
part of this sentence in a low voice. Secretary Chase, who was
sitting near the President, asked Mr. Lincoln if he had correctly
understood him, and the President repeated what he
had affirmed before, saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I made a solemn vow before God, that if General Lee was
driven back from Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by
the declaration of freedom for the slaves."&mdash;<i>Six Months in the
White House</i>, pp. 89, 90.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this threefold attestation we have irrefutable testimony
that the determining motive of President Lincoln in his issue
of the Emancipation Proclamation was the keeping of his
solemn covenant with God.</p>

<p>It is all but impossible to exaggerate the significance of this
incident. The essential fact is as fully proved as human testimony
can possibly prove a fact. When we remember the extreme
reticence of Abraham Lincoln on all such matters, and
the fact of which he must have been painfully conscious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
his Cabinet was not very favorably disposed toward the thing
that he proposed to do, his quiet, outspoken, and repeated declaration
that he had promised this thing to God is sufficient in
itself to settle forever the essentially religious character of
Abraham Lincoln. If we had no other word from his lips
touching on the subject of religion but this one, we should be
assured of his unfaltering belief in God, in a profound sense
of his own personal responsibility to God, in prayer, and a
personal relation with God.</p>

<p>This was no platitude uttered to meet the expectation of
the religious people of the United States; it was no evasive
generality intended to fit whatever religious desire might lie in
the minds of those who heard him. It was no play to the
gallery; it was no masquerade; every motive of pretense or
hypocrisy or duplicity was absent. It was the sincere expression
of the abiding faith of Abraham Lincoln in God, and
prayer, and duty.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Lincoln was a believer in the immortality of the soul.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Herndon affirms this and declares that any attempt to deny it
would imply that Lincoln was a dishonest man. He believed
in the preservation of identity beyond the grave so that we
shall be conscious of our own identity and be able to recognize
our loved ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>He believed in future punishment, but not in endless punishment.
Punishment seemed to him so inevitable a part of
an inexorable divine law that he sometimes objected to the
preaching of the doctrine of forgiveness as being subversive
of the fact of law, which he held must continue its sway in
this world and in every world; but in eternal punishment he
did not believe. His old neighbors in New Salem, his friends
in Springfield, and those who knew him in Washington agree
in this. We have already quoted from the letter of Isaac
Cogdal to Mr. B. F. Irwin, April 10, 1874, who tells of a
conversation he had with Mr. Lincoln in the latter's office in
Springfield about 1859, concerning Mr. Lincoln's religious
faith. Mr. Herndon was present. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Lincoln expressed himself in about these words:
He did not nor could not believe in the endless punishment of
anyone of the human race. He understood punishment for sin
to be a Bible doctrine; that the punishment was parental
in its object, aim, and design, and intended for the good of
the offender; hence it must cease when justice was satisfied.
He added that all that was lost by the transgression of Adam
was made good by the atonement; all that was lost by the fall
was made good by the sacrifice. And he added this remark,
that punishment being a provision of the gospel system, he was
not sure but the world would be better if a little more punishment
was preached by our ministers, and not so much pardon
for sin."</p></blockquote>

<p>William H. Hannah, in Lamon's group of citations, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since 1856 Mr. Lincoln told me that he was a kind of
immortalist; that he never could bring himself to believe in
eternal punishment; that man lived but a little while here;
and that, if eternal punishment were man's doom, he should
spend that little life in vigilant and ceaseless preparation by
never-ending prayer."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamon</span>: <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, p. 489.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some who have known of Lincoln's particular utterances
on certain of these points have been misled, as it appears to
me, by the similarity of some of these points to doctrines held
by particular religious sects and have sought to identify Lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>coln
more or less with those denominations. The fact that he
took portions of his positive thinking from Theodore Parker
and William Ellery Channing, does not necessitate that he was
a Unitarian; nor does the fact that he did not believe in eternal
punishment compel his classification with Universalists. Theodore
Parker and William E. Channing chanced to be the
authors whose writings came into his possession at a time
when they served to define particular aspects of his own faith.
Horace Bushnell, or Henry Ward Beecher might have served
him quite as well and possibly in some respects better. For
Lincoln's Calvinism was too deep-rooted to be eradicated; and
a positive faith, both liberal and constructive, that could have
been grafted on to that root might very possibly have served
him better than anything so radical as in its nature to deny any
essential part of what he felt he must continue to believe.
Parker and Channing served him as James Smith's <i>Christian's
Defence</i> and Robert Chambers' <i>Vestiges of Creation</i> served
him in assuring him that a man could hold the views he held
and know more about them than he knew and still be a reverent
Christian. Such a Christian Abraham Lincoln appears to me
to have been.</p>

<p>I do not think that any claim which I am here making
for the faith of Abraham Lincoln can be denied on the basis
of any authentic utterance of his. If at any point he is known
to have said or written anything which is apparently inconsistent
with these affirmations, that utterance I think will be
found somewhere in this volume and the reader will have no
difficulty in finding it and in giving it its proper weight. But
I do not think the general position which this chapter sets
forth can be seriously shaken. In the sense which this chapter
has endeavored truthfully to set forth, Abraham Lincoln believed
in God, in Christ, in the Bible, in prayer, in duty, and
in immortality.</p>

<p>Religion is one thing and theology is another. A love of
flowers is one thing and a knowledge of botany is another.
A man may love a flower and call it by the wrong name, or
know no name for it. A man may have the religion of Christ,
and hold very wrong opinions or conjectures concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Christ. We are saved by faith, not by conjecture. No man
is saved or lost because of the correctness of his opinions.
Correct thinking is important; but it is not so important as a
right attitude toward spiritual realities and practical duties.
Faith and opinion are not unrelated, but neither are they
identical.</p>

<p>Too much of the effort to prove that Abraham Lincoln
was a Christian has begun and ended in the effort to show
that on certain theological topics he cherished correct opinions.
That would not prove him to be a Christian, nor would the
lack of these certainly prove that he was not a Christian.
Religion is of the heart and life; theology is of the brain and
mind. Each is important, but theology is less important than
religion.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was not a theologian, and several of his
theological opinions may have been incorrect; but there is good
reason to believe that he was a true Christian. The world
has need of a few theologians, and of a great many Christians.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Lincoln's custom when he read a paragraph
which deeply interested him, to draw a pencil line around it
in the book; and if it was something which he wished to
commit to memory and meditate upon, he often copied it upon
a scrap of paper. I own a half page of notepaper containing
in Lincoln's handwriting and with his signature, a paragraph
from Baxter's "Saint's Rest." The manuscript was owned
by Hon. Winfield Smith, Lincoln's Attorney-General in 1864,
and was among his private papers when he died. The paragraph
reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is more pleasing to God to see his people study Him
and His will directly, than to spend the first and chief of
their effort about attaining comfort for themselves. We have
faith given us, principally that we might believe and live by
it in daily applications of Christ. You may believe immediately
(by God's help) but getting assurance of it may be the
work of a great part of your life."</p></blockquote>

<p>It would be interesting to know just what was in Lincoln's
mind when he read this paragraph, and sat down with pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and ink to copy and meditate upon it. The "comfort" which
Baxter was referring to in this passage was the comfort of
assurance of salvation in Christ. It was a theme on which
Mr. Lincoln heard many sermons, first and last, by Predestinarian
preachers, both Baptist and Presbyterian. If a man
was among the elect, how could he be sure of it, and what
means could he take to make the assurance more certain?
Baxter's answer was that assurance in this matter is less important
than to study and obey God's will; and that faith is
given us as something in whose exercise we may live daily
without greatly troubling ourselves about fathomless mysteries.
It was good doctrine for a man who had been reared
as Lincoln had been reared, and the remainder of the passage
was especially in line with his needs. He could believe immediately,
even though the assurance of faith was long delayed.
That assurance might be the work of a lifetime, but
faith was something that might be lived upon now. The
thought is akin to that in the fine lines of Lizzie York Case:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2m">"<i>There is no unbelief:</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>For thus by day and night unconsciously</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>The heart lives by the faith the lips deny,&mdash;</i></span><br />
<span class="i2m"><i>God knoweth why.</i>"</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A man can live by a faith of which he has not full assurance&mdash;so
said the sensible old Puritan, Richard Baxter&mdash;he
can live on it though it take him nearly all his life to gain
assurance; and I am certain he would have added, had he been
asked, that if assurance never came, and our heart condemn
us, "God is greater than our heart."</p>

<p>The carefully written paragraph in Lincoln's hand appears
to indicate that the thought was one which deeply impressed
Lincoln. Perhaps he felt that his own faith was of that sort,
a faith on which a man could live, while going forward in
the study and pursuit of the will of God, not seeking one's
own comfort or the joy of complete assurance, but finding in
the daily performance of duty the essential quality of true
faith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2></div>

<p class="c">THE CREED OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span> made no effort, so far as we know, to
formulate a creed. It would have been an exceedingly difficult
thing for him to have accomplished. His utterances on religious
subjects were not made as dogmatic affirmations. He
merely uttered as occasion seemed to him to demand such sentiments
and principles as expressed those aspects of truth which
he felt and believed to need expression at those particular
times. Nevertheless, these utterances together cover a somewhat
wide range; and while they were not intended to epitomize
any system of Christian doctrine, they make a nearer
approach to an epitome of this character than on the whole
might reasonably have been expected.</p>

<p>It will be interesting and profitable to close this study with
a series of short quotations from documents, letters, and addresses,
certified as authentic and touching directly upon points
of Christian doctrine. In most instances these have been
quoted already, with their context, but they are here brought
together in briefer form in order to facilitate our inquiry
whether they afford any material out of which might be made
some approach to a statement of Christian faith.</p>

<p><i>Materials for a Lincoln creed</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sincerely hope father may recover his health, but, at all
events, tell him to remember to call upon and confide in
our great and good and merciful Maker, who will not turn
away from him in any extremity. He notes the fall of a
sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads, and He will
not forget the dying man who puts his trust in Him....
If it be his lot to go now he will soon have a joyous meeting
with many loved ones gone before, and where the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
us with the help of God hope ere long to join them.&mdash;Letter
to his dying father, January 12, 1851. <i>Complete Works</i>,

<blockquote>

<p>Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended
him [Washington] I cannot succeed. With that assistance,
I cannot fail. Trusting in His care who can go with
me, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us
confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending
you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me,
I bid you an affectionate farewell.&mdash;Farewell Address, Springfield,
February 11, 1861. <i>Complete Works</i>, I, 672.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with His eternal truth
and justice, be on our side of the North, or on yours of the
South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the
judgment of this great tribunal of the American people....
Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on
Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still
competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty....
My dissatisfied fellow countrymen ... you
have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government,
while I have the most solemn one to preserve, protect, and

pure purpose, let us renew our trust in God and go forward
without fear and with manly hearts.&mdash;First Message to Congress,
July 4, 1861. <i>Complete Works</i>, II, 66.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas it is fit and becoming in all people, at all times,
to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of God;
to bow in humble submission to His chastisements; to confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and deplore their sins and transgressions, in the full conviction
that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and to
pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their
past offenses, and for a blessing upon their present and prospective
action:</p>

<p>And whereas when our own beloved country, once, by the
blessing of God, united, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted
with factions and civil war, it is particularly fit for us
to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation, and
in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a
nation and as individuals, to humble ourselves before Him and
to pray for His mercy.&mdash;National Fast Day Proclamation,
August 12, 1861. <i>Complete Works</i>, II, 73.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>In the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have
cause of great gratitude to God for unusual health and most
abundant harvest.... The struggle of today is not altogether
for today&mdash;it is for a vast future also. With a reliance
on Providence all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed
to the great task which events have devolved upon us.&mdash;Annual
Message to Congress, December 3, 1861. <i>Complete Works</i>,

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas it has seemed to me probable that the unsuccessful
application made for the commutation of his sentence may
have prevented the said Nathaniel Gordon from making the
necessary preparation for the awful change which awaits him:
Now therefore be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President
of the United States, have granted and do hereby grant unto
him, the said Nathaniel Gordon, a respite of the above recited
sentence, until Friday, the 21st of February, A.D. 1862....
In granting this respite it becomes my painful duty to admonish
the prisoner that, relinquishing all expectation of pardon by
human authority, he refer himself alone to the mercy of the
common God and Father of all men.&mdash;Proclamation of Respite
for a Convicted Slave Trader, February 4, 1862. <i>Complete

<blockquote>

<p>It has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories
to the land and naval forces.... It is therefore recommended
to the people of the United States that at their next
weekly assemblages ... they especially acknowledge and
render thanks to our Heavenly Father for these inestimable
blessings; that they then and there implore spiritual consolation
in behalf of all who have been brought into affliction by
the casualties and calamities of sedition and civil war; and
that they reverently invoke the Divine guidance to our national
counsels, to the end that they may speedily result in restoration
of peace, harmony, and unity.&mdash;Special Thanksgiving
Proclamation, April 10, 1862. <i>Complete Works</i>, II, 143.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The will of God prevails. In great contests each party
claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may
be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against
the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is
quite possible that God's purpose is something different from
the purpose of either party; and yet the human instrumentalities,
working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to
effect His purpose. I am almost ready to say that this is
probably true; that God wills this contest, and wills that it
shall not end yet. By His mere great power on the minds
of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed
the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
began. And, having begun, He could give the final victory
to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&mdash;A Meditation
on the Divine Will in the handwriting of Mr. Lincoln,
formulated about September 30, 1862, and not written for the
eye of men but apparently in the effort to define the moral
aspects of the subject and to clarify his own spiritual outlook.&mdash;<i>Complete
Works</i>, II, 243-44.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men to own
their dependence upon the overruling power of God; to confess
their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with
assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and
pardon; and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the
Holy Scriptures and proved by all history, that those nations
only are blest whose God is the Lord; And inasmuch as we
know that by His Divine law nations, like individuals, are subjected
to punishments and chastisements in this world, may
we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which
now desolates the land may be but a punishment inflicted upon
us for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of our
national reformation as a whole people?&mdash;Fast Day Proclamation,

controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled
me. Now at the end of three years' struggle, the
nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised

tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a great
wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>

dependence, not doubting that, if it shall please the Divine
Being who determines the destinies of nations, this shall remain
a united people, and that they will, humbly seeking the
Divine guidance, make their prolonged national existence a

shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the
Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to
deny that there is a God governing the world. It is a truth
which I thought needed to be told, and, as whatever of humiliation
there is in it falls most directly on myself, I thought others
might afford for me to tell it.&mdash;Letter to Thurlow Weed,

<blockquote>

<p>It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a
just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat
of other men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not
judged.... The Almighty has His own purposes. "Woe
unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be that
offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense
cometh." If we shall suppose that American slavery is one
of those offenses which, in the Providence of God, must needs
come, but which having continued through His appointed
time, He now will remove and that He gives to both North
and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom
the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from
those Divine attributes which the believers in a living God
always ascribe to Him. Fondly do we hope&mdash;perfectly do we
pray&mdash;that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass
away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth
piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited
toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the
sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still must it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
said, "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous
altogether."</p>

<p>With malice toward none; with charity for all; with
firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us
strive on to finish the work we are in.&mdash;Second Inaugural,

<p>No one of the foregoing quotations is taken from a private
conversation, nor copied from an unauthorized source. Some
very pleasing selections might have been made from reasonably
well-accredited sources, but all of the foregoing selections,
without any exception, are taken from the authentic
writings and addresses of Lincoln as compiled, edited, and
authenticated by his private secretaries, John G. Nicolay and
John Hay.</p>

<p>We might go much farther and could find a considerable
body of additional material, but this is sufficient and more
than sufficient for our purpose. In these utterances may be
found something of the determinism that was hammered into
Lincoln by the early Baptist preachers and riveted by James
Smith, along with some of the humanitarianism of Parker
and Channing, and much which lay unstratified in Lincoln's
own mind but flowed spontaneously from his pen or dropped
from his lips because it was native to his thinking and had
come to be a component part of his life. Anyone who cares
to do so may piece these utterances together and test his success
in making a creed out of them. They lend themselves
somewhat readily to such an arrangement.</p>

<p>In the following arrangement no liberties have been taken
except to change the past tense to the present, or the plural
to the singular, and to add connectives, and preface the words
"I believe." Except for changes such as these, which in no
way modify the sense or natural force of the utterances, the
creed which follows is wholly in the words of Abraham Lincoln.
A very little tampering with the text would have made
smoother reading, but this is not necessary. It has the simplicity
and the rugged honesty of the man who said these
words.</p>

<p class="c">THE CREED OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN<br />
IN HIS OWN WORDS</p>

<p>I believe in God, the Almighty Ruler of Nations, our
great and good and merciful Maker, our Father in Heaven,
who notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of

<p>I believe in His eternal truth and justice.</p>

<p>I recognize the sublime truth announced in the Holy Scriptures

<p>I believe that the Bible is the best gift which God has ever
given to men. All the good from the Saviour of the world

<p>I believe the will of God prevails. Without Him all human
reliance is vain. Without the assistance of that Divine Being,
I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail.</p>

<p>Being a humble instrument in the hands of our Heavenly

those who love me to His care, as I hope in their prayers
they will commend me, I look through the help of God to a
joyous meeting with many loved ones gone before.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the eleventh of February, 1861, on the day preceding
his fifty-second birthday, Mr. Lincoln set out for Washington.
He had sent special invitations to a few of his old friends to
accompany him as far as Indianapolis. That I was included in
the number, I shall be pardoned for remembering with peculiar
pleasure. That note of invitation is preserved among my most
cherished memorabilia of Abraham Lincoln. I shall ever regret
that imperative official duties would not allow me to join the
party.</p>

<p>"But I accompanied him to the railroad station, and stood
by his side on the platform of the car, when he delivered that
memorable farewell to his friends and neighbors. Of those, an
immense concourse had assembled to bid him good-by. The
day was dark and chill, and a drizzling rain had set in. The
signal bell had rung, and all was in readiness for the departure,
when Mr. Lincoln appeared on the front platform of the special
car&mdash;removed his hat, looked out for a moment upon the sea of
silent, upturned faces, and heads bared in loving reverence and
sympathy, regardless of the rain; and, in a voice broken and
tremulous with emotion and a most unutterable sadness, yet
slow and measured and distinct and with a certain prophetic
far-off look which no one who saw can ever forget, began:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>
<p>"'My friends, no one, not in my position can appreciate the
sadness I feel at this parting. To this people I owe all that I
am. Here I have lived more than a quarter of a century. Here
my children were born, and here one of them lies buried.
I know not how soon I shall see you again. A duty devolves
upon me which is greater, perhaps, than that which has devolved
upon any other man since the days of Washington. He
never would have succeeded, except for the aid of Divine Providence,
upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot
succeed without the same divine aid which sustained him; and
upon the same Almighty Being I place my reliance and support.
And I hope you, my friends, will pray that I may receive that
divine assistance, without which I cannot succeed, and with
which success is certain. Again, I bid you all an affectionate
farewell.'</p>

<p>"His pale face was literally wet with tears as he re-entered
the car, and the train rolled out of the city, which Abraham
Lincoln was to enter no more&mdash;till, his great work finished he
would come back from the war, a victor and a conqueror though
with the seal of death upon his visage. Some politicians derided
the solemn words of that farewell&mdash;but I knew they were the
utterances of his inmost soul&mdash;never did speech of man move me
as that did. Seeing every mournful tremor of those lips&mdash;noting
every shadow that flitted over that face&mdash;catching every inflection
of that voice&mdash;the words seemed to drop, every one, into my
heart, and to be crystallized in my memory. I hurried back to my
office, locked the door (for I felt that I must be alone), wrote
out the address from memory and had it published in the city
papers in advance of the reporters. And when the reports of
the stenographers were published, they differed from mine in
only two or three words, and as to even those, I have always
believed that mine were right for the speech was engraved on my
heart and my memory, and I had but to copy the engraving."&mdash;<i>Abraham
Lincoln</i>, an address by Hon. Newton Bateman, LL.D.,
published by the Cadmus Club, 1899, Galesburg.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's Farewell Address, as given by Mr. Bateman
in the foregoing quotation, would appear to have undergone some
revision by him after its printing. He says that he furnished it
to the press and that it came out in advance of the version taken
down by the reporter. On this point his memory appears to be
correct. The <i>Illinois State Journal</i> of February 12, 1861, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>tains
a report of Mr. Lincoln's address, which is almost certainly
that furnished by Mr. Bateman.</p>


<p class="c"><i>Lincoln's Farewell Address as Printed in the Illinois State<br />
Journal, February 12, 1860, probably from the notes of Hon.<br />
Newton Bateman.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Friends, no one who has never been placed in a like position,
can understand my feelings at this hour, nor the oppressive
sadness I feel at this parting. For more than a quarter of a
century I have lived among you, and during all that time I have
received nothing but kindness at your hands. Here I have lived
from my youth until now I am an old man. Here the most
sacred ties of earth were assumed; here all of my children
were born, and here one of them lies buried. To you, dear
friends, I owe all that I have, all that I am. All the strange,
checkered past seems now to crowd upon my mind. Today I
leave you: I go to assume a task more difficult than that which
devolved upon General Washington. Unless the great God who
assisted him shall be with me and aid me, I must fail. But if
the same Omniscient Mind and the same Almighty Arm that
directed and protected him shall guide and support me, I shall
not fail; I shall succeed. Let us all pray that the God of our
fathers may not forsake us now. To Him I commend you all;
permit me to ask that with equal sincerity [the word is printed
security but corrected with pen] and faith, you all will invoke
His wisdom and guidance for me. With these few words I
must leave you&mdash;for how long I know not. Friends, one and
all, I must now bid you an affectionate farewell."</p></blockquote>


<p class="c"><i>The So-called Shorthand Report</i></p>

<p>The so-called shorthand report appears on close examination
not to be a shorthand report, but is that which appeared in the
Chicago and other papers from the Hay and Lincoln revision,
more or less garbled in telegraphic transmission.</p>


<p class="c"><i>The Lincoln-Hay Version of the Farewell Address</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This address was correctly printed for the first time in the
Century Magazine for December, 1887, from the original manuscript,
having been written down after the train started, partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
by Mr. Lincoln's own hand and partly by that of his private
secretary from his dictation."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicolay and Hay</span>, <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
II, 291.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is thus apparent that we do not have any verbatim report
of the precise words which Lincoln uttered; but the Illinois
Historical Society has accepted this as the accredited version.
It is certainly that which Lincoln wished to be remembered as
having said; but it is quite possible that in one or two of the
variant words Bateman may have recalled it more accurately
than Lincoln himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My friends: No one not in my situation, can appreciate my
feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness
of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a
quarter of a century and have passed from a youth to an old
man. Here my children have been born and one is buried. I
now leave, not knowing when or whether ever I may return,
with a task before me greater than that which rested upon
Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being who
ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I
cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me and remain
with you and be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope
that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I
hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate
farewell."</p></blockquote>

<p class="c">By <span class="smcap">Artemus Ward</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Fowler</span> and other lecturers and authors have drawn for
us beautiful pictures of Lincoln reading to his Cabinet a chapter
in the Bible before submitting his draft of the Emancipation
Proclamation. The true story of that incident is related in the
foregoing pages. It may be that some readers who are unfamiliar
with the now little-read writings of "Artemus Ward"
will be glad to know precisely what it was that the President
read on that day; and as the chapter is very short, it will be
given herewith.</p>

<p>No form of literature is more evanescent than humor. The
fun-loving public of one generation labors hard to discover the
reasons why other generations laughed over the old-time jokes.
But there are elements in Artemus Ward that still provoke a
smile. The chapter which amused Lincoln on that day related
to the virtue of a community which would not permit the exhibition
of Artemus Ward's famous Wax Works because the reproduction
of the Last Supper contained the figure of Judas.
Some reader may need to be told that there was no such show.
The author of this and the other burlesques that bore the name
of Artemus Ward (Charles F. Browne), presented himself in
these sketches as a good-natured humbug, running a "highly
moral show" with "Wax-figgers" and other attractions. He
was never so delightful as when disclosing his own shams, as
when the mob pulled the hay out of the fat man.</p>

<p>Browne's book had a chapter in which he assisted Lincoln to
form his Cabinet. His first assistance was to turn out all the
office-seekers by threatening to turn his "Boy Constrictor" in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
among them; and then advised Mr. Lincoln to fill his Cabinet
with Showmen, all of whom were honest and had nary a politic;
"for particulars see small bills." This and other chapters delighted
Lincoln; but the one he read to his Cabinet just before
presenting the second draft of the Emancipation Proclamation,
was the following:</p>

<p class="c"><i>High-handed Outrage at Utica</i></p>

<p>In the Faul of 1856, I showed my show in Utiky, a trooly
grate sitty in the State of New York.</p>

<p>The people gave me a cordyal recepshun. The press was
loud in her prases.</p>

<p>1 day as I was giving a description of my Beests and Snaiks
in my usual flowry stile what was my skorn &amp; disgust to see a

of the Lord's Supper, and cease Judas Iscarrot by the feet and

<p>"What under the son are you abowt?" cried I.</p>

<p class="c">THE CONVERSION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p class="c">By the <span class="smcap">Rev. Edward L. Watson</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> religion of Abraham Lincoln is so much in debate that I
feel called upon to give the following narrative of an event of
which little seems to be known&mdash;and which is of real importance
in understanding the man. He has been called an infidel&mdash;an
unbeliever of varying degrees of blatancy. That he was a
Christian in the real sense of the term is plain from his life.
That he was converted during a Methodist revival seems not to
be a matter of common report. The personal element of this
narrative is necessary to unfold the story. In 1894 I was
appointed to the pastorate of the Hennepin Avenue Methodist
Episcopal Church, Minneapolis, Minn., by Bishop Cyrus D. Foss,
being transferred from Frederick, Md., a charge in Baltimore
Conference. It was in October that we entered the parsonage,
which was a double house, the other half being rented by the
trustees. Shortly after our occupancy of the church house
William B. Jacquess moved into the rented half of the property,
and through this fact I became acquainted with Col. James
F. Jacquess, his brother. At this time Colonel Jacquess was an
old man of eighty years or more, of commanding presence and
wearing a long beard which was as white as snow. His title
grew out of the fact of his being the commanding officer of the
Seventy-third Illinois Volunteer Infantry, known as the Preacher
Regiment. Its name was given through the publication in the
Cincinnati <i>Commercial</i> in September, 1862, of the roster of its
officers:</p>

<p>Colonel&mdash;Rev. James F. Jacquess, D.D., late president of
Quincy College.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel&mdash;Rev. Benjamin F. Northcott.</p>

<p>Major&mdash;Rev. William A. Presson.</p>

<p>Captains&mdash;Company B, Rev. W. B. M. Colt; Company C,
Rev. P. McNutt; Company F, Rev. George W. Montgomery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Company H, Rev. James I. Davidson; Company I, Rev. Peter
Wallace; Company K, Rev. R. H. Laughlin.</p>

<p>Six or seven of the twenty lieutenants were also licensed
Methodist preachers. Henry A. Castle, sergeant-major, was the
author of the article and a son-in-law, if I mistake not, of Colonel
Jacquess.</p>

<p>The history of this regiment is in brief, as follows: It was
organized at the instance of Governor Dick Yates, under Colonel
Jacquess, in August, 1862, at Camp Butler, in Illinois, and became
part of General Buell's army. It fought nobly at Perryville,
and in every battle in which the Army of the Cumberland
was engaged, from October, 1862, to the rout of Hood's army
at Nashville. Its dead were found at Murfreesboro, Chickamauga,
Missionary Ridge, where Colonel Jacquess won especial
distinction, and in the succession of battles from Chattanooga
to the fall of Atlanta. It was frequently complimented by the
commanding generals and was unsurpassed in bravery and endurance.
It left the State one of the largest, and returned one
of the smallest, having lost two-thirds of its men in its three
years' service.</p>

<p>Colonel Jacquess was its only colonel and came home disabled
by wounds received at Chickamauga, where two horses were
shot under him. He refused to the last (1897) to receive a pension,
until in his extreme old age, at the urgent request of the
Society of the Survivors of the Seventy-third Illinois, he allowed
it to be applied for. He pathetically said: "My grandfathers
were Revolutionary soldiers and you could get up a row
if you mentioned pensions. My father and my uncles were in
the War of 1812, and would take none. I had hoped not to
receive one&mdash;but I am unable now to do anything, and it has
been my desire, and not the fault of the government, that I
have never received a pension." These words were spoken in
1897&mdash;and not long afterward Colonel Jacquess went to his
reward.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the war President Lincoln sent Colonel
Jacquess as a secret emissary to arrange for peace and the
settlement of the slave question, so as to avert further shedding
of blood. His adventures in this role are of thrilling interest.
The foregoing is told to show the quality of the man whom it
was my privilege to meet in 1896, when he was in extreme old
age. The honors conferred upon him by President Lincoln and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the confidence reposed in him grew out of events which preceded
the war. This was no other than the conversion of Mr. Lincoln
under the ministry of the Rev. James F. Jacquess, at Springfield,
Ill., in the year 1839. The Rev. James F. Jacquess was stationed
at this new town&mdash;then of but a few thousand inhabitants&mdash;in
1839, when Lincoln met him during a series of revival services
conducted in the Methodist Episcopal Church. Lincoln had but
recently come to the town&mdash;having removed from New Salem,
which was in a decadent state. As a member of the Legislature,
Lincoln had been a chief agent in establishing the State capital
at Springfield, and though in debt and exceedingly poor, he hoped
to find friends and practice in the growing town. He was then
thirty years of age and had had few advantages of any sort.
It was on a certain night, when the pastor preached from the
text, "Ye must be born again," that Lincoln was in attendance
and was greatly interested. After the service he came round to
the little parsonage, and like another Nicodemus, asked, "How
can these things be?" Mr. Jacquess explained as best he could
the mystery of the new birth and at Lincoln's request, he and
his wife kneeled and prayed with the future President. It was
not long before Mr. Lincoln expressed his sense of pardon and
arose with peace in his heart.</p>

<p>The narrative, as told thus far, is as my memory recalled it.
Since writing it, the same as told by Colonel Jacquess has recently
been discovered by me in Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Eleventh Annual Reunion Survivors Seventy-third Regiment,
Illinois Infantry, Volunteers (page 30), a copy of which is
before me. This meeting, the last (probably), that Colonel
Jacquess attended, was held Tuesday and Wednesday, September
28, 29, 1897, in the Supreme Court room of the State Capitol
Building, Springfield, Ill. To quote Colonel Jacquess: "The
mention of Mr. Lincoln's name recalls to my mind an occurrence
that perhaps I ought to mention. I notice that a number of
lectures are being delivered recently on Abraham Lincoln.
Bishop Fowler has a most splendid lecture on Abraham Lincoln,
but they all, when they reach one point run against a stone wall,
and that is in reference to Mr. Lincoln's religious sentiments. I
happen to know something on that subject that very few persons
know. My wife, who has been dead nearly two years, was the
only witness of what I am going to state to you as having occurred.
Very soon after my second year's work as a minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
in the Illinois Conference, I was sent to Springfield. There were
ministers in the Illinois Conference who had been laboring for
twenty-five years to get to Springfield, the capital of the State.
When the legislature met there were a great many people here,
and it was thought to be a matter of great glory among the
ministers to be sent to Springfield. But I was not pleased with
my assignment. I felt my inability to perform the work. I did
not know what to do. I simply talked to the Lord about it,
however, and told Him that unless I had help I was going to run
away. I heard a voice saying to me, 'Fear not,' and I understood
it perfectly. Now I am coming to the point I want to
make to you. I was standing at the parsonage door one Sunday
morning, a beautiful morning in May, when a little boy came
up to me and said: 'Mr. Lincoln sent me around to see if you
was going to preach today.' Now, I had met Mr. Lincoln, but I
never thought any more of Abe Lincoln than I did of any one
else. I said to the boy: 'You go back and tell Mr. Lincoln that
if he will come to church he will see whether I am going to
preach or not.' The little fellow stood working his fingers and
finally said: 'Mr. Lincoln told me he would give me a quarter if
I would find out whether you are going to preach.' I did not
want to rob the little fellow of his income, so I told him to tell
Mr. Lincoln that I was going to try to preach. I was always
ready and willing to accept any assistance that came along, and
whenever a preacher, or one who had any pretense in that direction,
would come along I would thrust him into my pulpit and
make him preach, because I felt that anybody could do better
than I could.</p>

<p>"The church was filled that morning. It was a good-sized
church, but on that day all the seats were filled. I had chosen
for my text the words: 'Ye must be born again,' and during the
course of my sermon I laid particular stress on the word 'must.'
Mr. Lincoln came into the church after the services had commenced,
and there being no vacant seats, chairs were put in the
altar in front of the pulpit, and Mr. Lincoln and Governor
French and wife sat in the altar during the entire services, Mr.
Lincoln on my left and Governor French on my right, and I
noticed that Mr. Lincoln appeared to be deeply interested in
the sermon. A few days after that Sunday Mr. Lincoln called
on me and informed me that he had been greatly impressed with
my remarks on Sunday and that he had come to talk with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
further on the matter. I invited him in, and my wife and I
talked and prayed with him for hours. Now, I have seen many
persons converted; I have seen hundreds brought to Christ, and
if ever a person was converted, Abraham Lincoln was converted
that night in my house. His wife was a Presbyterian, but from
remarks he made to me he could not accept Calvinism. He never
joined my church, but I will always believe that since that night
Abraham Lincoln lived and died a Christian gentleman."</p>

<p>Here ends the narrative of Colonel Jacquess. Now compare
that which my memory preserved for the past thirteen years
and the Colonel's own printed account, and the discrepancies
are small. It is with pleasure I am able to confirm my memory
by the words of the original narrator. It is with no small
degree of pleasure that I am able to prove that Methodism had
a hand in the making of the greatest American. Colonel James
F. Jacquess has gone to his reward, but it is his honor to have
been used by his Master to help in the spiritualization of the
great man who piloted our national destinies in a time of exceeding
peril. It is an honor to him, and through him to the
denomination of which he was a distinguished member.</p>

<p class="c">THE LATER LIFE AND RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS OF<br />
ABRAHAM LINCOLN<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the fate and future of the Christian religion in nowise
depends upon the sentiments of Abraham Lincoln, yet the life
and character of this remarkable man belong to the public,
to tell for evil or for good on coming generations; and as the
attempt has been made to impute to him the vilest sentiments,
even to his dying day, it is fitting and just that the weakness and
infidelity charged upon his later life should not go down unchallenged
to posterity. The latest biography of Mr. Lincoln,
published under the name of Col. W. H. Lamon, but with the
large co-operation of Mr. W. H. Herndon, concerns itself with
the endeavor to establish certain allegations injurious to the
good name of the illustrious man, whose tragic and untimely
death has consecrated his memory in the hearts of a grateful
nation. Two charges in this biography are worthy of especial
notice and disproof,&mdash;the charge that he was born a bastard, and
the charge that he died an infidel. Mr. Lamon begins his pleasing
task by raising dark and unfounded insinuations as to the
legitimacy of his hero, and then occupies from twenty-five to
thirty pages with evidence to prove that Mr. Lincoln was a
confirmed infidel, and died playing a "sharp game on the Christian
community"; that, in his "morbid ambition for popularity,"
he would say good Lord or good Devil, "adjusting his religious
sentiments to his political interests." In meeting these insinuations
and charges I shall necessarily have recourse to political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
documents and papers, but it shall not be my aim to parade Mr.
Lincoln's political opinions, further than to eliminate from his
writings and speeches his religious sentiments.</p>

<p>As to the ungracious insinuation that Mr. Lincoln was not
the child of lawful wedlock, I have only to say that it is an
insinuation unsupported by a shadow of justifiable evidence.
The only thing on which Mr. Lamon bases the insinuation is,
that <i>he</i> has been unable to find any record of the marriage
Mr. Lincoln's parents. Just as if it would be any evidence
against the fact of their marriage if no record could be found.
If every man in this country is to be considered as illegitimate
who cannot produce his parents' certificate of marriage, or find
a record of it in a family Bible anywhere, there will be a good
many very respectable people in the same category with Mr.
Lincoln. Such an insinuation might be raised with as much
plausibility in the case of multitudes of the early settlers of the
country. It is a questionable act of friendship thus to rake "the
short and simple annals of the poor," and upon such slender
evidence raise an insinuation so unfounded. But I am prepared
to show that if Mr. Lamon has found no record of the marriage
of Mr. Lincoln's parents, it is simply because he has not extended
his researches as faithfully in this direction as he has in some
others. It appears that there is a well-authenticated record of
the marriage of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, and, in
the same connection, the birth of Abraham Lincoln and Sarah
Lincoln. Hearing that the Hon. J. C. Black, of Champaign, Ill.,
a warm personal friend of Mr. Lincoln, had in his possession
several papers given to him soon after Mr. Lincoln's death by a
member of the family, and among them a leaf from the family
Bible containing the record of the marriage of Mr. Lincoln's
parents, I at once telegraphed to him in relation to this record,
and have in my possession the following letter, which will explain
itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Champaign, Ill.</span>, Jan. 8th, 1873.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">J. A. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Your telegram of the 7th reached me this <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> In reply
permit me to say that I was in possession of the leaf of which you
speak, and which contained the record of the marriage of Thos. Lincoln
and Nancy Hanks, the birth of Abraham Lincoln and Sarah Lincoln.
The leaf is very old, and is the last page of the Apocrypha. It was given
to me, with certificate of genuineness, by Dennis F. Hanks in 1866. I
have sent both record and certificate to Wm. P. Black, attorney at law,
131 La Salle Street, Chicago, Ill., and duly by him delivered to the Illinois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Historical Association. Hon. I. N. Arnold called on my brother and
obtained the originals for use in a revised edition of his life of Lincoln,
and I understand that since then they have passed into the hands of
Robt. Lincoln, Esq., where they were when I last heard from them.
Hoping that what I have written may be of some use, I remain</p>

<p class="r">
Very truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">J. C. Black</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Presuming that the first of Colonel Lamon's libels upon Mr.
Lincoln's memory is thus sufficiently disposed of, I proceed to
consider the charges against his religious life and character. The
best refutation of these charges lies on the pages of the book
in which they are advanced. However skeptical Mr. Lincoln
may have been in his earlier life, Mr. Lamon persists in asserting
and attempting to prove that he continued a confirmed
skeptic to the last: that he was an unbeliever in the truth of
the Christian religion, and died an infidel; that, while "he was by
no means free from a kind of belief in the supernatural, he
rejected the great facts of Christianity as wanting the support
of authentic evidence"; that, "during all the time of his residence
at Springfield and in Washington, he never let fall from his lips
an expression which remotely implied the slightest faith in
Jesus Christ, as the Son of God and the Saviour of men"; that
"he was at all times an infidel." From twenty-five to thirty
pages of evidence is produced in proof of this allegation.</p>

<p>But all this positive statement as to Mr. Lincoln's persistent
and final infidelity is contradicted by the admissions of the book
itself. It is admitted that there did come a time in Mr. Lincoln's
life at Springfield when he began to affiliate with Christian
people, and to give his personal presence and support to the
Church. It is admitted that he did so plausibly identify himself
with the Christian community that "his New Salem associates
and the aggressive deists with whom he originally united at
Springfield gradually dispersed and fell away from his side."
Here is the fact, openly and squarely stated by Mr. Lamon, that
Mr. Lincoln, even while at Springfield, did make such a change
in his sentiments and bearing toward the Christian community,
that "the aggressive deists and infidels with whom he originally
united gradually dispersed and fell away from his side." He
no sooner turned away from them in sentiment than they turned
away from him in fact.</p>

<p>But how does the biographer attempt to explain this? How
does he account for this admitted and observable change in Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Lincoln's life, that relieved him of the presence of so much
aggressive deistical company? Why, by means of an explanation
that kills the accusation itself&mdash;an explanation that fastens
upon Mr. Lincoln the very charge of hypocrisy against which he
professes to defend him. He accounts for this admitted and observable
change in the attitude of Mr. Lincoln towards the
Christian community, not by supposing that there was any sincerity
about it, but by affirming that he was trying "to play a
sharp game on the Christians of Springfield!" It was because
"he was a wily politician, and did not disdain to regulate his
religious manifestations with reference to his political interests";
and because, "seeing the immense and augmenting power of the
churches, he aspired to lead the religious community, foreseeing
that in order to his political success he must not appear an enemy
within their gates." And yet, if we are to believe Colonel Lamon,
he was an enemy all the while at heart; and while attending
church, and supporting the Gospel, and making Sabbath school
speeches, and speeches before the Bible Society, he was at heart
a disbeliever of the truth and an antagonist of the cause which
he professed to be supporting. In other words, he was all these
years playing the arrant hypocrite; deceiving the Christian community
and wheedling it for political purposes; playing the role
of a gospel hearer in the sanctuary, and a hail fellow well met
with profane fellows of the baser sort in the private sanctum of
infidelity or "aggressive deism."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, however, Colonel Lamon and his companion
in authorship not only praise Mr. Lincoln's greatness, but laud
his singular conscientiousness and integrity of motive almost to
perfection. Says Mr. Herndon, "He was justly entitled to the
appellation, Honest Abe"; "honesty was his pole star; conscience,
the faculty that loves the just and the right, was the
second great quality and <i>forte</i> of Mr. Lincoln's character."
"He had a deep, broad, living conscience. His great reason told
him what was true and good, right and wrong, just or unjust,
and his conscience echoed back the decision, and it was from
this point he spoke and wove his character and fame among
us. His conscience ruled his heart." [See Herndon's letter in
Carpenter's <i>Life of Lincoln</i>.]</p>

<p>In confirmation of this, Mr. Lamon goes on to show that
Mr. Lincoln scorned everything like hypocrisy or deceit. In
fact he makes his hero to be such a paragon of honesty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
conscious integrity of motive that he would not undertake to
plead a bad cause before a jury if he could possibly shift the
responsibility over on to some other lawyer, whose conscience
was not quite so tender. He brings in the testimony of a most
reputable lawyer of another place in confirmation of this, who
states: "That for a man who was for a quarter of a century
both a lawyer and a politician, Mr. Lincoln was the most honest
man I ever knew. He was not only morally honest but intellectually
so. He could not reason falsely; if he attempted it
he failed. In politics he never would try to mislead. At the
bar, when he thought he was wrong, he was the weakest lawyer
I ever saw." "In a closely contested case where Mr. Lincoln
had proved an account for a client, who was, though he knew it
not, a very slippery fellow, the opposing attorney afterward
proved a receipt clearly covering the entire case. By the time
he was through Mr. Lincoln was missing. The court sent for
him to the hotel. 'Tell the judge,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'that I
can't come; my hands are dirty and I came over to clean them.'"</p>

<p>Page after page is thus taken to show Mr. Lincoln's singular
conscientiousness and honesty, his incapability of hypocrisy or
deceit, as a lawyer, a politician and a gentleman. And yet these
consistent biographers go back on all this testimony of their own
mouths when they come to explain the admitted change in his
life when he began to lean toward the church, and the "aggressive
deists" parted company with him. Then they find it convenient
to call him a "wily politician," who is "playing a sharp
game with the Christians"; "the cautious pretender who does
not disdain to regulate his religious manifestations with reference
to his political interests." They saddle upon him the vilest
hypocrisy and deceit, and make him "act the liar's part," in
order to send him down to posterity an infidel. On one page
they reason that Mr. Lincoln could not have made any such
admissions of his belief in the Christian religion as have been
maintained, as such admissions would be contrary to his well-known
character; on the next page they affirm that Mr. Lincoln
could not act the hypocrite; and on a third they do not hesitate
to attribute to him the very grossest duplicity, in their zeal to
fasten on him the charge of permanent skepticism. They go
back on their own logic, eat their own argument, and give the
lie to the very charge they are laboring with such considerable
pains to establish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>The book, therefore, I repeat, bears on its own pages the best
refutation of the charge it makes against Mr. Lincoln. Surely,
such serious inconsistency of statement, such illogical absurdity,
even, could hardly have escaped the notice of the biographers
if some preconceived opinion had not prejudiced their minds
and blinded their eyes. The <i>animus</i> of the book and the purpose
for which it was written are only too apparent.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might suffice to rest the refutation of this charge
against Mr. Lincoln's religious character on the internal evidence
of Colonel Lamon's volume with which I have thus far been occupied.
But there is something to be said concerning the authenticity
and accuracy of the testimony by which the charge seems
to be supported.</p>

<p>I have been amazed to find that the principal persons whose
testimony is given in this book to prove that their old friend
lived and died an infidel, never wrote a word of it, and never
gave it as their opinion or allowed it to be published as covering
their estimate of Mr. Lincoln's life and religious views. They
were simply familiarly interviewed, and their testimony misrepresented,
abridged and distorted to suit the purpose of the
interviewer, and the business he had on hand.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen whose names are most relied upon, and
who stand first on the list of witnesses to establish the charge
these biographers have made, are the Hon. John T. Stuart, and
Col. Jas. H. Matheny, of Springfield, old and intimate friends of
Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>Hon. John T. Stuart is an ex-member of Congress, and
was Mr. Lincoln's first law partner,&mdash;a gentleman of the highest
standing and ability in his profesion, and of unimpeachable
integrity. Mr. Lamon has attributed to Mr. Stuart testimony
the most disparaging and damaging to Mr. Lincoln's character
and opinions,&mdash;testimony which Mr. Stuart utterly repudiates,
both as to language and sentiment, as the following letter
shows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Springfield</span>, Dec. 17th, 1872.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Rev. J. A. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;My attention has been called to a statement in relation
to the religious opinions of Mr. Lincoln, purporting to have been made
by me and published in Lamon's <i>Life of Lincoln</i>. The language of that
statement is not mine; it was not written by me, and I did not see it
until it was in print.</p>

<p>I was once interviewed on the subject of Mr. Lincoln's religious
opinions, and doubtless said that Mr. Lincoln was in the earlier part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
his life an infidel. I could not have said that "Dr. Smith tried to convert
Lincoln from infidelity so late as 1858, and couldn't do it." In
relation to that point, I stated, in the same conversation, some facts
which are omitted in that statement, and which I will briefly repeat.
That Eddie, a child of Mr. Lincoln, died in 1848 or 1849,
and that he and his wife were in deep grief on that account. That
Dr. Smith, then Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Springfield,
at the suggestion of a lady friend of theirs, called upon Mr. and Mrs.
Lincoln, and that first visit resulted in great intimacy and friendship
between them, lasting till the death of Mr. Lincoln, and continuing with
Mrs. Lincoln till the death of Dr. Smith. I stated that I had heard,
at the time, that Dr. Smith and Mr. Lincoln had much discussion in
relation to the truth of the Christian religion, and that Dr. Smith had
furnished Mr. Lincoln with books to read on that subject, and among
others one which had been written by himself, some time previous, on
infidelity; and that Dr. Smith claimed that after this investigation Mr.
Lincoln had changed his opinion, and become a believer in the truth
of the Christian religion: that Mr. Lincoln and myself never conversed
upon that subject, and I had no personal knowledge as to his
alleged change of opinion. I stated, however, that it was certainly true,
that up to that time Mr. Lincoln had never regularly attended any place
of religious worship, but that after that time he rented a pew in the
First Presbyterian Church, and with his family constantly attended the
worship in that church until he went to Washington as President. This
much I said at the time, and can now add that the Hon. Ninian W.
Edwards, the brother-in-law of Mr. Lincoln, has, within a few days,
informed me that when Mr. Lincoln commenced attending the First
Presbyterian Church he admitted to him that his views had undergone
the change claimed by Dr. Smith.</p>

<p>I would further say that Dr. Smith was a man of very great ability
and on theological and metaphysical subjects had few superiors and not
many equals.</p>

<p>Truthfulness was a prominent trait in Mr. Lincoln's character, and
it would be impossible for any intimate friend of his to believe that he
ever aimed to deceive, either by his words or his conduct.</p>

<p class="r">
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">John T. Stuart</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Similar testimony, to the extent of a page or more of finely
printed matter, Mr. Lamon attributes to Col. Jas. H. Matheny,
of Springfield, Ill., an old acquaintance of Mr. Lincoln, an able
lawyer and of high standing in the community. Mr. Matheny
testifies that he never wrote a word of what is attributed to him;
that it is not a fair representation of either his language or his
opinions, and that he never would have allowed such an article
to be published as covering his estimate of Mr. Lincoln's life
and character. Here is what this gentleman has to say, given
over his own signature:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Springfield</span>, Dec. 16th, 1872.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Rev. J. A. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;The language attributed to me in Lamon's book is not
from my pen. I did not write it, and it does not express my sentiments
of Mr. Lincoln's entire life and character. It is a mere collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
sayings gathered from private conversations that were only true of Mr.
Lincoln's earlier life. I would not have allowed such an article to be
printed over my signature as covering my opinion of Mr. Lincoln's life
and religious sentiments. While I do believe Mr. Lincoln to have been
an infidel in his former life, when his mind was as yet unformed, and
his associations principally with rough and skeptical men, yet I believe
he was a very different man in later life; and that after associating
with a different class of men, and investigating the subject, he was a
firm believer in the Christian religion.</p>

<p class="r">
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jas. H. Matheny</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is unnecessary that I occupy more space with the rest of
the testimony, as there is none of it given over the signature
of anybody, save that which is given over the signature of W.
H. Herndon. All aside from this bears evidence of having been
manipulated to suit the purpose for which it is wanted, and is
either contradictory, or fails to cover the whole of Mr. Lincoln's
life. Judge Davis, for instance, is made to say: "I don't know
anything about Lincoln's religion, nor do I think anybody else
knows anything about it." Of what value can the testimony
be that is prefaced with such declarations of knowing nothing
about the matter?</p>

<p>John G. Nicolay is made to testify, that "to his knowledge
Mr. Lincoln did not change his views after he came to Washington";
and yet he states in immediate connection that "he does
not know what his views were, never having heard him explain
them."</p>

<p>Jesse W. Fell either testifies, or is made to testify, to Mr.
Lincoln's skeptical notions. And yet Mr. Fell admits that it "was
eight or ten years previous to his death" that he believed him
to be entertaining the views of which he speaks, "and that he
<i>may have changed his sentiments</i> after his removal from among
us." All this would be strange kind of testimony on which to
convict Mr. Lincoln of murder in the presence of a judge and
jury. But with such evidence it is sought to convict him of
infidelity.</p>

<p>We are enabled to see, therefore, in the light of this revelation,
of what "trustworthy materials" this book is composed;
how much Mr. Lamon's "names and dates and authorities, by
which he strengthens his testimony," are to be depended upon;
and what reason unsuspecting or sympathizing critics and journalists
have for arriving at the sage conclusion that Mr. Lincoln
"was, in his habit of thought, heterodox in the extreme to the
close of his life, and a very different man from what he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
supposed to be." The evidence of this book, so far as the prominent
witnesses are concerned, and so far as it relates to the
later years of Mr. Lincoln's life, is not only utterly untrustworthy,
but even an ingenious and romantic invention.</p>

<p>Having shown what claims Mr. Lamon's book has to being
the "only fair and reliable history" of Mr. Lincoln's life and
views, and of what "trustworthy materials" it is composed, I
shall now give the testimony I have collected to establish what
has ever been the public impression, that Mr. Lincoln was in
his later life, and at the time of his death, a firm believer in the
truth of the Christian religion. The infidelity of his earlier
life is not so much to be wondered at, when we consider the
poverty of his early religious instruction and the peculiar influences
by which he was surrounded. Gideon Welles, formerly
Secretary of the Navy, in a recent article in the <i>Galaxy</i>, in accounting
for the late and peculiar manifestation of faith which
Mr. Lincoln exhibited, says: "It was doubtless to be attributed
in a great measure to the absence of early religious culture&mdash;a
want of educational advantages in his youthful frontier life."
This, together with the fact that his youth and early manhood
were spent chiefly among a rough, illiterate and skeptical class of
people, is amply confirmed by Mr. Lamon's narrative.</p>

<p>On the same authority it appears that Mr. Lincoln had in
his former life read but few books, and that everything he had
read, of an intellectual character, bearing on the truth of the
Bible, was of an infidel sort. It does not appear that he had
ever seen, much less read, a work on the evidences of Christianity
till his interview with Rev. Dr. Smith in 1848. We hear of
him as reading Paine, Voltaire and Theodore Parker, but nothing
on the other side. The men by whom he was surrounded in his
earlier life, it seems, kept him well supplied with their kind of
literature. He was familiar with some of the master spirits of
infidelity and theism, but had never grappled with the evidences
of Christianity as presented by the great defenders of the
Christian faith.</p>

<p>But then Mr. Lincoln's mind was of too much greatness and
intellectual candor to remain the victim of a false theory in the
presence of clear and sufficient intellectual testimony. And he
no sooner, in the providence of God, was placed in possession of
the truth, and led to investigate for himself, than he stood firmly
and avowedly on the side of the Christian religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>In proof of this statement, I first of all produce the testimony
of Rev. Dr. Smith, Mr. Lincoln's pastor at Springfield. In relation
to Mr. Lincoln's opinion of Dr. Smith, it is only necessary
for me to state that he stood so high in his esteem, that he gave
him the appointment of Consul to Glasgow. Dr. Smith was in
Scotland at the time of Mr. Lincoln's death, and soon after
this sad event, Mr. Herndon conceived the notion of collecting
materials for his intended biography. He accordingly addressed
a letter to Dr. Smith in Scotland, with the view of getting some
information from so respectable a source to prove that Mr.
Lincoln had died an infidel. In this however he was mistaken,
to his evident chagrin and disappointment. I shall give some
extracts from Dr. Smith's printed letter, which is to be found
in the Springfield <i>Journal</i> of March, 1867, in which he gives
his opinion of both Mr. Herndon and Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">East Cainno, Scotland</span>, 24th Jan. 1867.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">W. H. Herndon, Esq.</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Your letter of the 20th Dec. was duly received. In it you ask
me to answer several questions in relation to the illustrious President
Abraham Lincoln. With regard to your second question, I beg leave
to say it is a very easy matter to prove that while I was pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of v Springfield, Mr. Lincoln did avow his
belief in the divine authority and inspiration of the Scriptures, and I
hold that it is a matter of the last importance not only to the present,
but all future generations of the Great Republic, and to all advocates
of civil and religious liberty throughout the world, that this avowal on
his part, and the circumstances attending it, together with very interesting
incidents illustrative of the excellence of his character, in my possession,
should be made known to the public. I am constrained, however, most
respectfully to decline choosing you as the medium through which such
a communication shall be made by me. [Omitting that portion of the
letter which bears on Mr. Herndon, I give what is written in vindication
of Mr. Lincoln.&mdash;J. A. R.] My intercourse with Abraham Lincoln
convinced me that he was not only an honest man, but preëminently an
upright man&mdash;ever ready, so far as in his power, to render unto all their
dues.</p>

<p>It was my honor to place before Mr. Lincoln arguments designed
to prove the divine authority and inspiration of the Scriptures, accompanied
by the arguments of infidel objectors in their own language. To
the arguments on both sides Mr. Lincoln gave a most patient, impartial,
and searching investigation. To use his own language, he examined the
arguments as a lawyer who is anxious to reach the truth investigates
testimony. The result was the announcement by himself that the argument
in favor of the divine authority and inspiration of the Scriptures
was unanswerable. I could say much more on this subject, but as you
are the person addressed, for the present I decline. The assassin Booth,
by his diabolical act, unwittingly sent the illustrious martyr to glory,
honor, and immortality; but his false friend has attempted to send him
down to posterity with infamy branded on his forehead, as a man who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
notwithstanding all he suffered for his country's good, was destitute of
those feelings and affections without which there can be no real excellency
of character. Sir, I am with due respect your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Jas. Smith</span>.
</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;It will no doubt be gratifying to the friends of Christianity to
learn that very shortly after Mr. Lincoln became a member of my congregation,
at my request, in the presence of a large assembly at the annual
meeting of the Bible Society of Springfield, he delivered an address the
object of which was to inculcate the importance of having the Bible
placed in possession of every family in the State. In the course of it
he drew a striking contrast between the Decalogue and the moral codes
of the most eminent lawgivers of antiquity, and closed (as near as I can
recollect) in the following language: "It seems to me that nothing
short of infinite wisdom could by any possibility have devised and given
to man this excellent and perfect moral code. It is suited to men in
all conditions of life and includes all the duties they owe to their Creator,
to themselves, and to their fellow-men."</p>

<p class="r">
J. S.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lamon, aware of the importance of Dr. Smith's testimony,
attempts to break the force of it by the <i>argumentum ad
nauseam</i>. He alludes to Dr. Smith as a gentleman of "slender
abilities for the conversion of so distinguished a person, and
as having in his zeal composed a heavy tract out of his own
head to suit the particular case, and that he afterwards <i>drew</i>
the acknowledgment from Mr. Lincoln that it was unanswerable,"
and that he himself is the only man that can testify of
such an admission on the part of Mr. Lincoln. This is all the
gratuitous assertion of a man who is driven to the wall for
evidence to prove his point. Now John T. Stuart has already
testified to Dr. Smith's abilities as a theologian and a metaphysician
having few superiors. He testifies to the fact that
Dr. Smith's work was not written to suit Mr. Lincoln's case.
It was written previously, before Dr. Smith ever saw Mr. Lincoln.
Nor is it true that Dr. Smith is the only one who can
testify to an admission on the part of Mr. Lincoln of a change
of sentiments. There are many residents of Springfield, both
ladies and gentlemen, who can testify to this admission. I give
one or two letters as a sample.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Springfield</span>, Dec. 24th, 1872.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Rev. Jas. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;A short time after the Rev. Dr. Smith became pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church in this city, Mr. Lincoln said to me, "I
have been reading a work of Dr. Smith on the evidences of Christianity,
and have heard him preach and converse on the subject, and I am now
convinced of the truth of the Christian religion."</p>

<p class="r">
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">N. W. Edwards</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Springfield</span>, Jan. 6th, 1873.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Rev. J. A. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Not long after Dr. Smith came to Springfield, and I
think very near the time of his son's death, Mr. Lincoln said to me,
that when on a visit somewhere, he had seen and partially read a work
of Dr. Smith on the evidences of Christianity which had led him to
change his views about the Christian religion; that he would like to get
that work to finish the reading of it, and also to make the acquaintance
of Dr. Smith. I was an elder in Dr. Smith's church, and took Dr. Smith
to Mr. Lincoln's office and introduced him, and Dr. Smith gave Mr.
Lincoln a copy of his book, as I know, at his own request.</p>

<p class="r">
Yours, &amp;c.,<br />
<span class="smcap">Thos. Lewis</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many others who can testify that Mr. Lincoln,
both publicly and privately while at Springfield, made the admission
of his belief in the truth of the Christian religion. He
did it in most unequivocal language, in addresses before the
Bible Society and in Sabbath school.</p>

<p>I next refer to the testimony of Rev. Dr. Gurley, Mr. Lincoln's
pastor at Washington City. Even if, before his election
to the Presidency, Mr. Lincoln had entertained the sentiments
attributed to him, after he had reached the pinnacle of political
elevation, there was certainly no necessity for him any longer
to be "playing a sharp game with the Christians," and destroying
his peace of mind by wearing the mask of hypocrisy. He was
surely free now to worship where he felt most comfortable.
But we no sooner find him in Washington than we find him
settling down under the ministry of Dr. Gurley, a sound and
orthodox minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Dr. Gurley was
his intimate friend, and spiritual counselor and adviser, during
the most trying and difficult time of his life. He was with him
not only in the hours of his personal family bereavement, but
when his heart was heavy and perplexed with the welfare of
his country. Having been associated with Dr. Gurley in the
charge of his pulpit for a time previous to his death, and being
intimately acquainted with him, I have had the opportunity of
knowing what his views of Mr. Lincoln's sentiments were. In
the funeral oration which Dr. Gurley delivered in Washington,
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Probably since the days of Washington no man was ever
so deeply and firmly embedded and enshrined in the hearts of
the people as Abraham Lincoln. Nor was it a mistaken confidence
and love. He deserved it&mdash;deserved it all. He merited
it by his character, by his acts, and by the whole tone and tenor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
of his life.... His integrity was thorough, all-pervading, all-controlling
and incorruptible. He saw his duty as the Chief
Magistrate of a great and imperiled people, and he determined
to do his duty, seeking the guidance, and leaning on the arm of
Him of whom it is written: 'He giveth power to the faint,
and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.'</p>

<p>"Never shall I forget the emphatic and deep emotion with
which he said in this very room, to a company of clergymen who
called to pay their respects to him in the darkest days of our
civil conflict: 'Gentlemen, my hope of success in this struggle
rests on that immutable foundation, the justness and the goodness
of God; and when events are very threatening I shall hope
that in some way all will be well in the end, because our cause
is just and God will be on our side.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This was uttered when Dr. Gurley was not aware, as I suppose,
that Mr. Lincoln had ever been charged with entertaining
infidel sentiments. While sitting in the study one day with him,
conversing on Mr. Lincoln's character, I asked him about the
rumor of his infidelity then being circulated by Mr. Herndon.
He said, "I do not believe a word of it. It could not have been
true of him while here, for I have had frequent and intimate
conversations with him on the subject of the Bible and the
Christian religion, when he could have had no motive to deceive
me, and I considered him sound not only on the truth of the
Christian religion but on all its fundamental doctrines and teaching.
And more than that: in the latter days of his chastened
and weary life, after the death of his son Willie, and his visit
to the battlefield of Gettysburg, he said, with tears in his eyes,
that he had lost confidence in everything but God, and that he
now believed his heart was changed, and that he loved the
Saviour, and if he was not deceived in himself, it was his intention
soon to make a profession of religion." Language to
this effect Mr. Lincoln, it appears, used in conversation with
other persons, and I refer next to the corroborating testimony
of Noah Brooks, Esq., now associated with the New York
<i>Tribune</i>. This gentleman has already published most interesting
testimony in relation to Mr. Lincoln's religious sentiments in
<i>Harper's Monthly</i> of July, 1865. In order that his testimony
may be fully appreciated, I will here state, on the authority of
a mutual friend, that "Mr. Brooks is himself an earnest Christian
man, and had the appointment of private secretary to the Presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>dent,
to which office he would have acceded had Mr. Lincoln
lived. He was so intimate with the President that he visited him
socially at times when others were refused admission, took tea
with the family, spending evenings with him, reading to him,
and conversing with him freely on social and religious topics,
and in my opinion knows more of the secret inner life and religious
views of Mr. Lincoln, at least during the term of his
presidency, than any man living." The following is a letter
which I have received from Mr. Brooks in relation to his views
of Mr. Lincoln's religious sentiments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, Dec. 31st, 1872.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Rev. J. A. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>&mdash;In addition to what has appeared from my pen, I will
state that I have had many conversations with Mr. Lincoln, which were
more or less of a religious character, and while I never tried to draw
anything like a statement of his views from him, yet he freely expressed
himself to me as having "a hope of blessed immortality through Jesus
Christ." His views seemed to settle so naturally around that statement,
that I considered no other necessary. His language seemed not that
of an inquirer, but of one who had a prior settled belief in the fundamental
doctrines of the Christian religion. Once or twice, speaking to
me of the change which had come upon him, he said, while he could
not fix any definite time, yet it was after he came here, and I am very
positive that in his own mind he identified it with about the time of
Willie's death. He said, too, that after he went to the White House
he kept up the habit of daily prayer. Sometimes he said it was only
ten words, but those ten words he had. There is no possible reason
to suppose that Mr. Lincoln would ever deceive me as to his religious
sentiments. In many conversations with him, I absorbed the firm conviction
that Mr. Lincoln was at heart a Christian man, believed in the
Saviour, and was seriously considering the step which would formally
connect him with the visible Church on earth. Certainly, any suggestion
as to Mr. Lincoln's skepticism or infidelity, to me who knew him intimately
from 1862 till the time of his death, is a monstrous fiction&mdash;a
shocking perversion.</p>

<p class="r">
Yours truly,<br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extract I add also from Mr. Brooks's article
in <i>Harper's Monthly</i> of July, 1865: "There was something touching
in his childlike and simple reliance on Divine aid, especially
when in such extremities as he sometimes fell into; then, though
prayer and reading the Scriptures was his constant habit, he
more earnestly than ever sought that strength which is promised
when mortal help faileth. He said once, 'I have been many
times driven to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I
had nowhere else to go. My own wisdom, and that of all about
me, seemed insufficient for that day.' At another time he said,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>'I am very sure that if I do not go away from here a wiser
man, I shall go away a better man for having learned here what
a very poor sort of a man I am.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Carpenter, author of <i>Six Months in the White House</i>,
whose intimacy with Mr. Lincoln gives importance to his testimony,
says that "he believed Mr. Lincoln to be a sincere Christian,"
and among other proofs of it gives another well-authenticated
admission (made by Mr. Lincoln to an estimable lady
of Brooklyn, laboring in the Christian Commission) of a change
of heart, and of his intention at some suitable opportunity to
make a profession of religion.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton Bateman, Superintendent of Public Instruction
in the State of Illinois, a gentleman of rare literary attainments,
and of unquestionable veracity, has given very important testimony
in relation to one particular point, more especially, Mr.
Lincoln's belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Both Mr. Herndon
and Mr. Lamon persist in asserting that Mr. Lincoln never
used the name of Jesus Christ except to deny His divinity, and
that Mr. Bateman is "the sole and only man who dare say
that Mr. Lincoln believed Jesus Christ to be the Son of God."</p>

<p>Mr. Bateman testifies that in 1860, Mr. Lincoln in conversation
with him used the following language: "I know that there
is a God, and that He hates injustice and slavery. I see the
storm coming, and I know that His hand is in it. If He has
a place and a work for me, and I think He has, I believe I am
ready. I am nothing, but truth is everything. I know I am
right, because I know that liberty is right, for Christ teaches
it and Christ is God. I have told them a house divided against
itself cannot stand; and Christ and reason say the same, and
they will find it so," &amp;c. This testimony was originally given
in Holland's <i>Life of Lincoln</i>. Mr. Herndon, at first unwilling
to impeach Mr. Bateman's veracity, suggests a doubt "whether
he is correctly reported in Holland's history"; presently, however,
summoning courage, he ventures the affirmation: "On my
word the world may take it for granted that Holland is wrong;
that he does not state Mr. Lincoln's views correctly." He then
goes on to say that "between himself and Dr. Holland, Mr.
Bateman is not in a very pleasant situation." We have seen,
however, that Mr. Herndon's "word," in a matter where his
prejudices are so violent and his convictions so obstinate, is
hardly a sufficient denial with which to oppose the deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
and unretracted statement of an intelligent and reputable witness.
And Mr. Bateman has no need to be disturbed, so long as
the "unpleasantness" of his situation is occasioned by no more
serious discomfort than Mr. Herndon's unsupported contradiction.
As the matter now stands, Mr. Herndon offers a denial,
based on general impressions as to Mr. Lincoln's character,
against the direct, specific, and detailed testimony of a careful
and competent man as to what he heard with his own ears. Mr.
Herndon simply did not hear what Mr. Bateman did hear; and
is in the position of that Irishman on trial for his life, who, when
one witness swore directly that he saw the accused commit the
crime, proposed to put upon the stand a dozen witnesses who
could swear they did <i>not</i> see him.</p>

<p>Mr. Lamon also states that Mr. Bateman is a respectable
citizen, whose general reputation for truth and veracity is not
to be impeached, but his story, as reported in Holland's <i>Life
of Lincoln</i>, is so inconsistent with Mr. Lincoln's whole character
that it must be rejected as altogether incredible. Unfortunately,
however, for Mr. Lamon, he has not so impressed us with the
trustworthy nature of the materials of his own book, as that
we can afford to distrust the honesty and integrity of either Dr.
Holland or Mr. Bateman for his sake. If anybody's story of
Mr. Lincoln's life and sentiments is to be "rejected as inconsistent
and altogether incredible," the testimony thus far would
seem to indicate that it is Mr. Lamon's story. At least that is
the "unpleasant situation" in which we shall leave the matter,
so far as Mr. Bateman and Dr. Holland are concerned in it.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bateman is not the only one who can testify that
Mr. Lincoln did use the name of the Saviour, and believed him
to be the Christ of God. I have given several instances already
in which he used the name of Christ as his Saviour, and avowed
that he loved Him. Moreover, he could not have avowed his
belief in the truth of the Christian religion, as many witnesses
testify, if he did not believe Jesus to be the Christ of
God.</p>

<p>To the various testimony which we have thus far cited it
only remains for me to add the testimony of his own lips. In
his address to the colored people of Baltimore, on the occasion
of the presentation of a copy of the Bible, Mr. Lincoln said:
"In regard to this great Book, I have only to say, it is the
best gift which God has ever given to man. All the good from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
the Saviour of the world is communicated to us through this
Book."</p>

<p>To the Hon. H. C. Deming, of Connecticut, he said that the
"article of his faith was contained in the Saviour's condensed
statement of both law and gospel&mdash;'Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Herndon affirms that Mr. Lincoln did not believe in
the "Christian dogma of the forgiveness of sin": he believed
that "God would not and could not forgive sin. He did not
believe in forgiveness through Christ, nor in fact in any doctrine
of forgiveness. In reading Mr. Lincoln's proclamations, however,
we find that he does very distinctly recognize the doctrine
of the forgiveness of sin on the part of God, and very earnestly
implores the people to seek the forgiveness of their sins. In
his proclamation of a fast day, August, 1861, are these words:</p>

<p>"And, whereas, it is fit and becoming in all people, at all
times, to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of
God; to bow in humble submission to his chastisements; to
confess and deplore their sins and transgressions, in the full
conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
and to pray with all fervency and contrition for the <i>pardon</i> of
their past offenses, and for a blessing on their present and
prospective action," etc.</p>

<p>Read also his proclamation enforcing the observance of the
Christian Sabbath in the Army and Navy, and ask yourself,
Could an infidel have done this?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, desires
and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and
men in the military and naval service. The importance for man and
beast of the prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers
and sailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian
people, and a due regard for the Divine will, demand that Sunday labor
in the Army and Navy be reduced to the measure of a strict necessity.
The discipline and character of the National forces should not suffer,
nor the cause they defend be imperiled, by the profanation of the day
and the name of the Most High. At this time of public distress, adopting
the words of Washington in 1776, "Men may find enough to do in
the service of God and their country without abandoning themselves
to vice and immorality." The first general order issued by the Father
of his Country, after the Declaration of Independence, indicates the
spirit in which our institutions were founded and should ever be defended:
"The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will
endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the
dearest rights and liberties of his country."</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides all this, we find Mr. Lincoln often using the very
language of the Saviour, as not only expressing but giving the
sanction of Divine authority to his own views and opinions.
What a remarkable instance of it in the solemn words that
fell from his lips in his last inaugural, as he stood on the steps
of the Capitol! Standing upon the verge of his grave, as he
was that day, and addressing his last official words to his countrymen,
his lips touched as with the finger of inspiration, he
said:</p>

<p>"The Almighty has His own purposes. 'Woe unto the
world because of offenses, for it must needs be that offenses
will come; but woe unto the man by whom the offense cometh.'
If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of these offenses
which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which,
having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to
remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible
war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall
we discern any departure therein from those Divine attributes
which the believers in a living God always ascribe to him?
Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that the mighty scourge
of war may pass away. Yet if God will that it continue until
all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty
years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of
blood drawn with the lash shall be paid with another drawn
by the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so must
it still be said, 'The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous
altogether.'"</p>

<p>Thus it appears, that whether Mr. Lincoln was ever accustomed
to blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ or not, or whether
he was ever accustomed to deny His divinity or not, as his
defamers allege, he is willing, in the last eventful days of his
life, standing at the nation's Capitol, in the hearing of the
swelling multitude that hangs upon his lips, to use the sanction
of Divine authority to one of the most remarkable sentences of
his official address.</p>

<p>Hon. Isaac N. Arnold, of Chicago, an intimate acquaintance
of Mr. Lincoln, and who is engaged in a review of his work on
Mr. Lincoln's life, writes me that "from the time he left Springfield,
with the touching request for the prayers of his friends
and neighbors, to the day of his death, his words were the words
of a Christian, revering the Bible, and obeying its precepts. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
spirit of reverence and deep religious feeling pervades nearly
all the public utterances and state papers of his later life."</p>

<p>The following interesting testimony from Rev. Dr. Byron
Sunderland, of the First Presbyterian Church of Washington
City, gives us a little insight into the philosophy of Mr. Lincoln's
mind and religious sentiments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Washington City</span>, Nov. 15th, 1872.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Rev. Jas. A. Reed</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bro.</span>&mdash;It was in the last days of 1862, about the time Mr.
Lincoln was seriously contemplating the issuing of the Emancipation
Proclamation, that I, in company with some friends of the President,
called upon him. After some conversation, in which he seemed disposed
to have his joke and fun, he settled down to a serious consideration of
the subject before his mind, and for one half-hour poured forth a volume
of the deepest Christian philosophy I ever heard. He began by saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ways of God are mysterious and profound beyond all comprehension&mdash;'who
by searching can find Him out?' Now, judging after
the manner of men, taking counsel of our sympathies and feelings, if
it had been left to us to determine it, we would have had no war. And
going further back to the occasion of it, we would have had no slavery.
And tracing it still further back, we would have had no evil. There is
the mystery of the universe which no man can solve, and it is at that
point that the human understanding utterly backs down. And then
there is nothing left but for the heart of man to take up faith and believe
and trust where it cannot reason. Now, I believe we are all agents
and instruments of Divine providence. On both sides we are working
out the will of God; yet how strange the spectacle! Here is one half
the nation prostrated in prayer that God will help them to destroy the
Union and build up a government upon the cornerstone of human
bondage. And here is the other half equally earnest in their prayers
and efforts to defeat a purpose which they regard as so repugnant to
their ideas of human nature and the rights of society, as well as liberty
and independence. They want slavery; we want freedom. They want a
servile class; we want to make equality practical as far as possible. And
they are Christians, and we are Christians. They and we are praying
and fighting for results exactly the opposite. What must God think of
such a posture of affairs? There is but one solution&mdash;self-deception.
Somewhere there is a fearful heresy in our religion, and I cannot think
it lies in the love of liberty and in the aspirations of the human soul.</p>

<p>"What I am to do in the present emergency time will determine.
I hold myself in my present position and with the authority vested in
me as an instrument of Providence. I have my own views and purposes,
I have my convictions of duty, and my notions of what is right to be
done. But I am conscious every moment that all I am and all I have
is subject to the control of a Higher Power, and that Power can use
me or not use me in any manner, and at any time, as in His wisdom and
might may be pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am no fatalist. I believe in the supremacy of the
human conscience, and that men are responsible beings; that God has
a right to hold them, and will hold them, to a strict personal account for
the deeds done in the body. But, sirs, I do not mean to give you a
lecture upon the doctrines of the Christian religion. These are simply
with me the convictions and realities of great and vital truths, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
power and demonstration of which I see now in the light of this our
national struggle as I have never seen before. God only knows the issue
of this business. He has destroyed nations from the map of history
for their sins. Nevertheless my hopes prevail generally above my fears
for our own Republic. The times are dark, the spirits of ruin are
abroad in all their power, and the mercy of God alone can save us."</p>

<p>So did the President discourse until we felt we were imposing on
his time, and rising we took our leave of him, confident that he would
be true to those convictions of right and duty which were derived from
so deep a Christian philosophy.</p>

<p class="r">
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Byron Sunderland</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Miner, Pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Springfield, who was intimately acquainted with Mr. Lincoln,
and visited him and his family in Washington previous to his
death, has left most interesting testimony in reference to Mr.
Lincoln's religious sentiments, confirmatory of what has been
given, and which is preserved in the archives of the University
of Chicago. Dr. Miner sums up his impressions of Mr. Lincoln
as follows: "All that was said during that memorable afternoon
I spent alone with that great and good man is engraven too
deeply on my memory ever to be effaced. I felt certain of this
fact, that if Mr. Lincoln was not really an experimental Christian,
he was acting like one. He was doing his duty manfully,
and looking to God for help in time of need; and, like the immortal
Washington, he believed in the efficacy of prayer, and
it was his custom to read the Scriptures and pray himself."
And here I would relate an incident which occurred on the 4th
of March, 1861, as told me by Mrs. Lincoln. Said she: "Mr.
Lincoln wrote the conclusion of his inaugural address the morning
it was delivered. The family being present, he read it to
them. He then said he wished to be left alone for a short time.
The family retired to an adjoining room, but not so far distant
but that the voice of prayer could be distinctly heard. There,
closeted with God alone, surrounded by the enemies who were
ready to take his life, he commended his country's cause and
all dear to him to God's providential care, and with a mind
calmed with communion with his Father in heaven, and courage
equal to the danger, he came forth from that retirement ready
for duty."</p>

<p>With such testimony, gathered from gentlemen of the highest
standing, and much more that I could add to confirm it, I leave
the later life and religious sentiments of Abraham Lincoln to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the dispassionate and charitable judgment of a grateful people.
While it is to be regretted that Mr. Lincoln was not spared to
indicate his religious sentiments by a profession of his faith
in accordance with the institutions of the Christian religion, yet
it is very clear that he had this step in view, and was seriously
contemplating it, as a sense of its fitness and an apprehension
of his duty grew upon him. He did not ignore a relation to
the Christian church as an obsolete duty and an unimportant
matter. How often do we hear him thanking God for the
churches! And he was fast bringing his life into conformity
to the Christian standard. The coarse story-telling of his early
days was less indulged in in his later life. Hon. Isaac N. Arnold,
and Mr. Carpenter, as well as Mr. Lincoln's physician at Washington,
Dr. Stone, all testify that "while his stories and anecdotes
were racy, witty, and pointed beyond all comparison," yet they
"never heard one of a character needing palliation or excuse."
His physician, Dr. Stone, testifies that "Mr. Lincoln was the
purest-hearted man he ever came in contact with."</p>

<p>His disposition to attend the theater in later life (if to anyone
it seems to need apology) was not so much a fondness for the
playhouse as a relief from his mental anxiety, and an escape from
the incessant pressure of visitors at the White House. "It is
a well-known fact," says Dr. Miner, "that he would not have
been at the theater on that fatal night, but to escape the multitude
who were that evening pressing into the White House to
shake hands with him. It has been said that Mrs. Lincoln urged
her husband to go to the theater against his will. This is not
true. On the contrary, she tried to persuade him not to go,
but he insisted. He said, 'I must have a little rest. A large
and overjoyed, excited people will visit me tonight. My arms
are lame by shaking hands with the multitude, and the people
will pull me to pieces.' He went to the theater, not because
he was interested in the play, but because he was care-worn and
needed quiet and repose. Mrs. Lincoln informed me that he
seemed to take no notice of what was going on in the theater
from the time he entered it till the discharge of the fatal pistol.
She said that the last day he lived was the happiest of his life.
The very last moments of his conscious life were spent in conversation
with her about his future plans, and what he wanted
to do when his term of office expired. He said he wanted to
visit the Holy Land and see the places hallowed by the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>prints
of the Saviour. He was saying there was no city he so
much desired to see as <i>Jerusalem</i>; and with that word half
spoken on his tongue, the bullet of the assassin entered his brain,
and the soul of the great and good President was carried by
angels to the New Jerusalem above."</p>

<p class="c">TWO HERNDON LETTERS CONCERNING LINCOLN'S<br />
RELIGION</p>

<p class="c little">BRIEF ANALYSIS OF LINCOLN'S CHARACTER</p>


<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Springfield, Ill</span>., Sept. 10, 1887.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">J. E. Remsburg</span>, Oak Mills, Kansas.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friend Remsburg</span>: Today I send you Speed's lecture on
"Lincoln," which you can keep till I send for it&mdash;and this will
probably be never. It is a very poor lecture if the lecture contains
his knowledge of Lincoln, and, I guess it does. It shows no
insight into Lincoln at all, though it is well enough written.
It is said that Speed had a world of influence over Lincoln.
This may be so, and yet I never saw it. It is said by Nicolay
and Hay that Lincoln poured out his soul to Speed. Bah!
Nonsense! Probably, except in his love scrapes, Lincoln never
poured out his soul to any mortal creature at any time and on
no subject. He was the most secretive, reticent, shut-mouthed
man that ever existed.</p>

<p>You had to <i>guess</i> at the man after years of acquaintance
and then you must look long and keenly before you <i>guessed</i>, or
you would make an ass of yourself.</p>

<p>You had to take some leading&mdash;great leading and well-established&mdash;fact
of Lincoln's nature and then follow it by accurate
and close analysis wherever it went.</p>

<p>This process would lead you correctly if you knew human
nature and its laws. Lincoln was a mystery to the world;
he loved principle, but moved ever just to suit his own ends;
he was a trimmer among men, though firm on laws and great
principles; he did not care for men; they were his tools and
instruments; he was a cool man&mdash;an unsocial one&mdash;an abstracted
one, having the very quintessence of the profoundest policies.
Lincoln's heart was tender, full of mercy, if in his presence some
imaginative man presented the subject to him. "Out of sight,
out of mind" may truthfully be said of Lincoln. If I am correct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
what do you think of the stories afloat about what Lincoln said
in relation to his religion, especially said to strangers? I send
you two "Truth-Seekers" which you will please read where I
speak of Lincoln in three letters, pages marked at the top.
You will learn something of Lincoln's nature in those three letters
of mine&mdash;two of them on Lincoln's religion, and one to a
minister. Please read them. There are some quotations in these
letters which I have never had time to send you as I recollect
it. They are good things&mdash;one on Laws of Human Nature
and one on the Pride-Haughtiness of Christians. Lincoln delivered
a lecture in which these quotations are to be found. I heard
him deliver it.</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">W. H. Herndon.</span>
</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Mr. Speed was my boss for three or four years and
Lincoln, Speed, Hurst, and I slept in the same room for a year
or so. I was clerk for Speed. Speed could make Lincoln do
much about simple measures, policies, not involving any principle.
Beyond this power Speed did not have much influence over
Lincoln nor did anyone else.</p>

<p class="c little">A CARD AND A CORRECTION</p>

<p>I wish to say a few short words to the public and private
ear. About the year 1870 I wrote a letter to F. E. Abbott,
then of Ohio, touching Mr. Lincoln's religion. In that letter
I stated that Mr. Lincoln was an infidel, sometimes bordering
on atheism, and I now repeat the same. In the year 1873 the
Right Rev. James A. Reed, pastor and liar of this city, gave
a lecture on Mr. Lincoln's religion, in which he tried to answer
some things which I never asserted, except as to Mr. Lincoln's
infidelity, which I did assert and now and here affirm. Mr.
Lincoln was an infidel of the radical type; he never mentioned
the name of Jesus except to scorn and detest the idea of miraculous
conception. This lecture of the withered minister will
be found in Holland's Review [<i>Scribner's Monthly</i>]. I answered
this lecture in 1874, I think, in this city to a large and intelligent
audience&mdash;had it printed and sent a copy to Holland, requesting,
in polite language, that he insert it in his Review as an answer
to the Reed lecture. The request was denied me, as a matter
of course. He could help to libel a man with Christian courage,
and with Christian cowardice refuse to unlibel him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon thereafter, say from 1874 to 1882, I saw floating around
in the newspaper literature, such charges as "Herndon is in a
lunatic asylum, well chained," "Herndon is a pauper," "Herndon
is a drunkard," "Herndon is a vile infidel and a knave,
a liar and a drunkard," and the like. I have contradicted all
these things under my own hand, often, except as to my so-called
infidelity, liberalism, free religious opinions, or what-not. In the
month of October, 1882, I saw in and clipped out of the Cherryvale
<i>Globe-News</i> of September, 1882, a paper published in the
State of Kansas, the following rich and racy article; it is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="c">
"<i>Lincoln's Old Law Partner a Pauper</i>
</p>

<p>"Bill Herndon is a pauper in Springfield, Ill. He was once worth
considerable property. His mind was the most argumentative of any
of the old lawyers in the State, and his memory was extraordinary.
For several years before Lincoln was nominated for the Presidency,
Herndon was in some respects the most active member of the firm,
preparing the greatest number of cases for trial and making elaborate
arguments in their behalf. It is said that he worked hard with Lincoln
in preparing the memorable speeches by the man who afterward became
President, during the debates between Lincoln and Douglas in 1858, and
in constructing the Cooper Union address delivered by Lincoln a short
time before the war. Herndon, with all his attainments, was a man who
now and then went on a spree, and it was no uncommon thing for him
to leave an important lawsuit and spend several days in drinking and
carousing. This habit became worse after Lincoln's death, and like poor
Dick Yates, Herndon went down step by step till his old friends and
associates point to him as a common drunkard."</p></blockquote>

<p>There are three distinct charges in the above article. First,
that I am a pauper. Second, that I am a common drunkard,
and third, that I was a traitor or false to my clients. Let me
answer these charges in their order. First, I am not a pauper.
Never have been and expect never to be. I am working on
my farm, making my own living with my own muscle and brain,
a place and a calling that even Christianity with its persecution
and malignity can never reach me to do much harm. I had,
it is true, once a considerable property, but lost much of it
in the crash and consequent crisis of 1873, caused in part by
the contraction of the currency, in part by the decline in the
demand for the agricultural products which I raise for sale, in
part by the inability by the people to buy, etc., etc., and for no
other reasons.</p>

<p>Second, I never was a common drunkard, as I look at it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
and am not now. I am and have been for years an ardent and
enthusiastic temperance man, though opposed to prohibition by
law, by any force or other choker. The time has not come
for this. It is a fact that I once, years ago, went on a spree;
and this I now deeply regret. It however is in the past, and
let a good life in the future bury the past. I have not fallen,
I have risen, and all good men and women will applaud the
deed, always excepting a small, little, bitter Christian like the
Right Rev. pastor and liar of this city, to whom I can trace
some of the above charges. In my case this minister was an
eager, itching libeler, and what he said of me is false&mdash;nay, a
willful lie.</p>

<p>Third, I never was a traitor or untrue to my clients or
their interests. I never left them during the progress of a trial
or at other times for the cause alleged, drunkenness. I may
have crept&mdash;slid&mdash;out of a case during the trial because I had
no faith in it, leaving Mr. Lincoln, who had faith in it, to run
it through. My want of faith in a case would have been discovered
by the jury and that discovery would have damaged
my client and to save my client I dodged. This is all there is
on it, and let men make the most of it.</p>

<p>Now, let me ask a question. Why is all this libeling of me?
I am a mere private citizen, hold no office, do not beg the people
to give me one often. My religious ideas, views, and philosophy
are today, here, unpopular. But wait, I will not deny my ideas,
views, or philosophy for office or station or the applause of
the unthinking multitude. I can, however, answer the above
question. It, the libeling, is done because I did assert and affirm
by oral language and by print that Mr. Lincoln was an infidel,
sometimes bordering on atheism, and yet he was among the best,
greatest, and noblest of mankind; he was a grand man. Why
do not the Christians prove that Mr. Lincoln was an evangelical
Christian and thus prove me a liar? One of my friends, for
whom I have great respect, says, that "Mr. Lincoln was a
<i>rational</i> Christian because he believed in morality." Why not
say Lincoln was <i>rational</i> Buddhist, as Buddhism teaches morality?
Why not say Lincoln was <i>rational</i> Mohammedan? By
the way, let me say here, that I have a profound respect for an
earnest, manly, and sincere Christian or an Atheist, a profound
respect for an earnest, manly, and sincere Infidel or theist or
any other religion, or the men who hold it, when that belief is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
woven into a great manly character to beautify and greaten the
world.</p>

<p>These charges, and I do not know how many more, nor of
what kind, have been scattered broadcast all over the land, and
have gone into every house, have been read at every fireside till
the good people believe them, believe that I am nearly as mean
as a little Christian, and all because I told the truth and stand
firm in my conviction. Respectfully,</p>

By <span class="smcap">B. F. Irwin</span>
</p>
<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Pleasant Plains, Ill.</span>, April 20, 1874.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Editor State Journal</span>: For some time, I believe, in 1870
there has been a constant and continued effort upon the part
of the Hon. W. H. Herndon, Springfield, Ill., to convince and
prove to the world that Abraham Lincoln lived and died an infidel.
He has succeded, as I suppose, in proving that proposition
to his own entire satisfaction and probably to the satisfaction
of some others. The last effort I have noticed upon the
subject was Herndon's reply to the Rev. J. A. Reed, in a lecture
delivered in the court house in Springfield, some months ago.
A few days after that lecture was delivered, I was urgently
requested by a prominent minister of the gospel and friend of
Lincoln's (and also a lady friend now residing in Kansas) to
review that speech. I promised each of those persons I would
do so at the proper time. That time has now arrived, and I
propose noticing a few points in the address of Mr. Herndon,</p>

<p class="c little">"THE RELIGION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN"</p>

<p>also a point or two in his Abbott letter and I think I will be
able to show that Mr. Herndon, himself, never knew or under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>stood
really what the faith of Lincoln was or what the</p>

<p class="c little">RELIGIOUS BELIEF OF LINCOLN</p>

<p>was. I wish it now and here understood that Mr. Herndon's
candor or veracity I do not call in question. Nor will I designedly
say anything to offend him. He and I have been for
twenty-five years good personal friends, and I hope that friendship
may continue. Mr. Herndon has a right to prove Mr.
Lincoln an infidel if he can. I claim the same right to prove that</p>

<p class="c little">LINCOLN WAS NOT AN INFIDEL</p>

<p>if I can. If Mr. Lincoln was an infidel, as Herndon says, it
is proper for the world to know it. If he was not an infidel the
charge is wrong and a slander, for infidelity in the nineteenth
century is no honor to any man, dead or alive.</p>

<p>Mr. Herndon, in his speech, uses this language: "One side
of this question can be proved. It is admitted on all hands that
Lincoln once was an infidel; that he wrote a small book, or essay,
or pamphlet against Christianity, and that he (Lincoln) continued
an unbeliever until late in life." Herndon further says: "It is a
rule of law, as well as a rule of common sense, that when a
certain state or condition of affairs is once proved to exist, the
presumption is, that it still exists until the contrary is proved."
Now I stand by that proposition as a true one. Will Mr. Herndon
do so? But</p>

<p class="c little">HE IS WOEFULLY MISTAKEN</p>

<p>in his statement that "all admit that Lincoln was once an infidel."
I have never yet heard one single man express the
belief that Lincoln was an infidel, either early or late in life,
while I am confident I have heard one hundred different persons
express astonishment at Mr. Herndon writing and publishing
Lincoln to the world an infidel. Mr. Herndon, it is true, did
have opportunities and advantages over others in knowing Mr.
Lincoln's religious opinions. But other men had some opportunities
as well as Mr. Herndon, and to them I shall have to
appeal, for I do not claim to personally know anything about
Mr. Lincoln's religious faith. Though personally acquainted
with Lincoln for twenty-five years, and often in his office, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
never heard him say a word on the subject of Christianity or
religious belief. Hence, my opinion of Lincoln's faith or belief
is based on the testimony of those who do know, who had it</p>

<p class="c little">FROM LINCOLN HIMSELF;</p>

<p>and I believe them, for the weight of testimony is certainly
against Mr. Herndon. The Scriptures of Truth lay it down as a
Divine rule, that the evidence of two or three witnesses is better
than one. Common law lays down the same rule, borrowed
from Divine authority, and our courts are governed by it in their
decisions.</p>

<p>Mr. Herndon, in his</p>

<p class="c little">REPLY TO MR. REED,</p>

<p>says, "He is talking to establish the truth of a controversy
between those who hold that Lincoln was a disbeliever, and
those who hold that he died a Christian (a believer in Christ)"
and then says: "If I fail to establish my point it will be because
of the manner and method of presenting the facts." I have read
that lecture carefully over, and I fail to find any proof of Herndon's
proposition that Lincoln ever was an infidel or an unbeliever.
The nearest I see to it, is the</p>

<p class="c little">STATEMENT OF J. H. MATHENY</p>

<p>He uses this language, substantially: "Mr. Lincoln's earlier
life is his whole life and history in Illinois up to the time he
left for Washington City. He (Lincoln) was, as I understand
it, a confirmed infidel." Now, Matheny fails to tell us how
he got that understanding. Did he get it from Lincoln? He
don't say so, and the reason he don't say so doubtless is, he
got it from some other source&mdash;probably from Herndon. But
clearly, to be of any weight as evidence, he must have that understanding
from Mr. Lincoln himself. Mr. Matheny may have
some time in life heard Lincoln use some of the</p>

<p class="c little">ARGUMENTS OF TOM PAINE,</p>

<p>or advance infidel ideas, and still not be an infidel. I have heard
an official member of the Methodist Church in this town advance
as strong infidel sentiments as Tom Paine ever did, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
would insult the man to say he was an infidel. So any Christian
may use the language or advance some of the sentiments of Tom
Paine and be far from an infidel. Lincoln may have done all
that, and still not be an infidel. I do not believe Mr. Lincoln
ever was an infidel, and I can truly state and say just what
Matheny said. I understood Lincoln was an infidel, but I never
believed the statement true. Matheny understood it: in other
words, he had heard it but knew nothing about the facts in the
case. I have seen Mr. Matheny since, and he states that he</p>

<p class="c little">NEVER HAD IT FROM LINCOLN</p>

<p>that he was an infidel, and he never believed it.</p>

<p>If Mr. Herndon is in possession of the evidence, in writing
or otherwise, to prove that Lincoln was an infidel, either earlier
or later in life, he ought to bring forward the proof to sustain
his proposition: for he has long since learned that the statement
alone fails to satisfy the public mind that Lincoln ever was an
infidel. Mr. Herndon in his</p>

<p class="c little">ABBOTT LETTER</p>

<p>truly says the charge of infidelity was made against Mr. Lincoln
when he was a candidate for Congress in 1848; and then adds:
"Mr. Lincoln did not deny the charge, because it was true."
The charge of infidelity was made against Lincoln at that time,
and I suppose Lincoln made no public denial of the charge, for
the reason that the canvass was being made on political grounds,
and not religious faith or belief. This much was said at the
time, as I well remember to be the facts in the case.</p>

<p>About the time of building the flatboat on the Sangamon
River in 1830, when Lincoln was quite a young man, a</p>

<p class="c little">RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY</p>

<p>was the topic in which Lincoln took a part; and in the argument
Lincoln used the language that, according to the history
of the case, in the New Testament, Christ was a bastard and
his mother a base woman. This he may have used at the time,
as young men sometimes do use vain language, and seventeen
years afterward, when he was a candidate for Congress against</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p class="c little">PETER CARTWRIGHT</p>

<p>a Methodist preacher, that vain remark was remembered, and
Tom Paine having used similar language, Lincoln was published
in some of the papers as an infidel. The above was the explanation
published at the time, and the charge of infidelity
did no harm. Had Lincoln been known as an infidel, or believed
to be one at that time, I am certain he would have been beaten
badly by Cartwright in the canvass.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Herndon, in his Abbott letter (I believe it is),
says: "It is not to be found in print that Lincoln ever used the
word Christ." In fact, Herndon says, "he never did use it, only
to deny Christ as the son of God." Now that statement may
be true, that he did not use the term Christ: but if Mr. Herndon
will examine the speeches of the public men of this nation, I
believe I am safe in saying that Mr. Lincoln used and</p>

<p class="c little">QUOTED MORE SCRIPTURE</p>

<p>than any man in the nation; and that he quoted the parables and
language of Christ oftener than any public man living. Not only
did Lincoln quote Scripture, but he used it as being of Divine
authority, and applicable to the affairs of earth. Mr. Herndon
gives us to understand that Lincoln did not believe the New
Testament Scriptures to be any more inspired than Homer's
songs, Milton's "Paradise Lost," or Shakspeare. If Herndon
is correct, it seems strange Lincoln made no use of those books.
On the 16th of January, 1858,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> as a foundation for an argument,
he used the language of Christ</p>

<p class="c little">"A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND,"</p>

<p>in reply to Douglas. In the same campaign he four times used
the parables of Christ; in his second inaugural address&mdash;"woe
unto the world because of its offenses"&mdash;Christ's language, again.</p>

<p>But I need not multiply quotations. His speeches, proclamations,
and messages are so full of quotations of scripture, always
the language of Christ himself, that if an angel of light should
proclaim it trumpet-tongued from the skies, that Lincoln was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
an unbeliever in Christ, I could not believe it. He could not
have been an infidel without being a base hypocrite; and I don't
believe a more honest man lived on earth.</p>

<p class="c little">THE EVIDENCE</p>

<p>Now I will take up some evidence on the question being
discussed. Mr. Herndon has said that, in Lincoln's early life,
he wrote</p>

<p class="c little">A PAMPHLET</p>

<p>book, or manuscript against Christianity. I propose to show that
the manuscript written by Lincoln was</p>

<p class="c little">IN FAVOR OF CHRISTIANITY</p>

<p>To do so, I will offer the evidence of Mr. Graham, who knew
Lincoln when he was a boy in Kentucky, with whom Lincoln
boarded some two years; and if any man on earth ought to
know Lincoln's religious faith or belief, that man is Mentor
Graham, who was intimate with Lincoln from the time he came
to Illinois to the time he left for Washington City. I will give
the letter in full.</p>

<p class="c little">STATEMENT OF MR. GRAHAM</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Petersburg, Ill.</span>, March 17, 1874.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">B. F. Irwin</span>:
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;In reply to your inquiries, Abraham Lincoln was living
at my house in New Salem, going to school, studying English
grammar and surveying, in the year 1833. One morning he said
to me, "Graham, what do you think about the anger of the
Lord?" I replied, "I believe the Lord never was angry or
mad and never would be; that His loving kindness endurest
forever; that He never changes." Said Lincoln, "I have a little
manuscript written, which I will show you"; and stated he
thought of having it published. Offering it to me, he said he
had never showed it to anyone, and still thought of having it
published. The size of the manuscript was about one-half
quire of foolscap, written in a very plain hand, on the subject
of Christianity and a defense of universal salvation. The commencement
of it was something respecting the God of the uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>verse
never being excited, mad, or angry. I had the manuscript
in my possession some week or ten days. I have read many books
on the subject of theology and I don't think in point of perspicuity
and plainness of reasoning, I ever read one to surpass
it. I remember well his argument. He took the passage, "As
in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive," and
followed up with the proposition that whatever the breach or
injury of Adam's transgressions to the human race was, which
no doubt was very great, was made just and right by the atonement
of Christ.</p>

<p>As to Major Hill burning the manuscript, I don't believe he
did, nor do I think he would have done such a thing. About
the burning of a paper by Hill, I have some recollection of his
snatching a letter from Lincoln and putting it into the fire. It
was a letter written by Hill to McNamur. His real name was
McNeal. Some of the school children had picked up the letter
and handed it to Lincoln. Hill and Lincoln were talking about
it, when Hill snatched the letter from Lincoln and put it into
the fire. The letter was respecting a young lady, Miss Ann
Rutledge, for whom all three of these gentlemen seemed to
have respect. Yours truly,</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Mentor Graham</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Now the next point I wish to notice is Mr. Herndon's statement,
in his Abbott letter, that Lincoln, in 1846, was charged
with being an infidel. Herndon says he [Lincoln] did not deny
the charge, because it was true. As I have before stated, I admit
the charge was made, and I think at the time there was no public
denial by Lincoln, for the reason that the canvass was made
on political grounds, and not religious faith or belief. Nevertheless,
the charge was denied, as the following letter will show.</p>

<p class="c little">STATEMENT OF THOMAS MOSTILLER</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Pleasant Plains, Ill.</span>, April 28, 1874.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">B. F. Irwin</span>:
</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;In regard to your inquiry, just received, of what I
heard Lincoln say about a charge of infidelity made against
him when a candidate for Congress in 1847, or '48, it was this.
I was present and heard Josiah Grady ask Lincoln a question or
two regarding a charge made against Lincoln of being an infidel,
and Lincoln unqualifiedly denied the charge of infidelity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
said, in addition, his parents were Baptists, and brought him
up in the belief of the Christian religion; and he believed in
the Christian religion as much as anyone, but was sorry to say
he had or made no pretensions to religion himself. I can't give
his exact words, but would make oath anywhere that he positively
denied the charge made against him of infidelity. That
was the first time I ever heard of the charge of infidelity against
Lincoln.</p>

<p>Grady did not say that he would not vote for Lincoln if he
was an infidel; but my understanding from Grady was, that he
would not vote for Lincoln if he was an infidel, and Grady did,
as I suppose, vote for him. I understood him that he should.</p>

<p>The next evidence I shall offer is that of Isaac Cogdal, an
intimate friend of Lincoln's from the time Lincoln came to
Salem, Menard County, to the time he left for Washington
City, and I will let Cogdal speak for himself.</p>

<p class="c little">STATEMENT OF ISAAC COGDAL</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r">
April 10, 1874.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. F. Irwin</span>: Yours received making inquiries about what I
heard Lincoln say about his religious belief, is this, as near as
I can tell it and recollect. I think it was in 1859, I was in
Lincoln's office in Springfield, and I had a curiosity to know his
opinions or belief religiously; and I called on him for his faith
in the presence of W. H. Herndon. At least Herndon was in
the office at the time. Lincoln expressed himself in about these
words: He did not nor could not believe in the endless punishment
of any one of the human race. He understood punishment
for sin to be a Bible doctrine; that the punishment was parental
in its object, aim, and design, and intended for the good of the
offender; hence it must cease when justice is satisfied. He added
that all that was lost by the transgression of Adam was made
good by the atonement: all that was lost by the fall was made
good by the sacrifice, and he added this remark, that punishment
being a "provision of the gospel system, he was not sure but
the world would be better off if a little more punishment was
preached by our ministers, and not so much pardon of sin." I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
then, in reply, told Mr. Lincoln he was a sound Universalist, and
would advise him to say but little about his belief, as it was
an unpopular doctrine, though I fully agreed with him in sentiment.
Lincoln replied that he never took any part in the argument
or discussion of theological questions. Much more was
said, but the above are the ideas as advanced by Lincoln there.</p>

<p class="r">
Respectfully yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Isaac Cogdal</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The next witness I shall offer on the subject is Jonathan
Harnett, of Pleasant Plains. Mr. Harnett is here. I shall now
furnish a statement over his signature, as he is present and
dictates as I write.</p>

<p class="c little">DICTATED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN HARNETT</p>

<p>Mr. Harnett says, that in 1858, a short time after he came
to Illinois, he had a curiosity to see Lincoln and went into his
office. There were several others in that he did not know;
that religious faith seemed to be the subject of conversation.
After some time was spent in the controversy, it seemed to be
Lincoln's time, and in a few words he heard Lincoln condense
into a small space greater thoughts and larger ideas, and sounder
logic, than he ever heard brought into so small space. Lincoln,
he says, covered more ground in a few words than he could
in a week, and closed up with the restitution of all things to
God, as the doctrine taught in the scriptures, and if anyone was
left in doubt in regard to his belief in the atonement of Christ
and the final salvation of all men, he removed those doubts in
a few questions he answered and propounded to others. After
expressing himself, some one or two took exceptions to his
position, and he asked a few questions that cornered his interrogators
and left no room to doubt or question his soundness
on the atonement of Christ, and salvation finally of all men.
He did not pretend to know just when that event would be consummated,
but that it would be the ultimate result, that Christ
must reign supreme, high over all, The Saviour of all; and the
supreme Ruler, he could not be with one out of the fold; all
must come in, with his understanding of the doctrine taught in
the scriptures.</p>

<p>[The above statement since writing it has been read to Mr.
Harnett and indorsed by him.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>The next evidence I shall offer is Erasmus Manford, of
Chicago. About 1850, he had a debate in Springfield, Ill., with
Mr. Lewis. In his book, "Twenty-five Years in the West,"
page 219, he says: "I remember well seeing Mr. Lincoln then
punctually every day and night. He often nodded his head to me
when I made a strong point." Does that look as though Lincoln
was an infidel? Manford was discussing the proposition of
the restitution of all things to God which is manifested in Christ
Jesus our Lord. Manford gives the quotation, chapter, and
verse, and Lincoln nods assent to the position. That nodding
assent to the restitution agrees precisely with Mr. Harnett's
statement of Lincoln's position in his presence seven or eight
years afterward. Everyone understands that nodding assent to
the argument of a speaker is an indorsement of what is said,
and about equivalent to speaking it yourself. Manford so understood
it: so anyone would understand it.</p>

<p>My next and last witness is W. H. Herndon. In his Abbott
lecture in 1870, Herndon says that Lincoln's belief was, that</p>

<p class="c little">ALL WOULD BE SAVED,</p>

<p>or none. That remark he frequently or often made; that agrees
with Harnett's statement that he believed all would be saved.
When a man believes all men will be saved, he can then be logical
and say all will be saved or none, and not otherwise. In the
same letter, Mr. Herndon says Mr. Lincoln held that God had
a fixed punishment for sin and no means could bribe him to
remit that punishment. That evidence agrees with Cogdal's
statement that sin was to be punished, but not endlessly. Both
Herndon and Cogdal agree in the statement that Lincoln believed
that if our ministers would preach punishment and not
so much pardon the world would be benefited by it.</p>

<p>I am now through with the evidence I shall offer at this
time, though I could add the evidence of a dozen more to the
same purport. I think I have clearly proved that</p>

<p class="c little">LINCOLN WAS A UNIVERSALIST</p>

<p>in 1833; that he wrote a manuscript on that subject then; that
in 1847 he</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p class="c little">DENIED THE CHARGE</p>

<p>of infidelity; that in 1850-58-59 he was still a Universalist. If
this be true when was he an infidel? But to get a clear understanding
of the case, Universalism and infidelity are as far
apart as the poles. Universalism maintains that there is one
God, whose nature is love revealed in our Lord Jesus Christ.
This Lincoln certainly believed, infidelity denies it. Universalism
maintains that Christ was the Son of God; infidelity denies it.
Universalism maintains that the Old and New Testament Scriptures
contain a record of God's revelation to man; infidelity
denies it, and says the New Testament is no more inspired than
Homer's songs, Milton's "Paradise Lost," or Shakspeare. My
authority for the infidel view is W. H. Herndon, in his letter.</p>

<p>Before closing, I wish it distinctly understood that if I could
show that</p>

<p class="c little">LINCOLN WAS NOT AN INFIDEL</p>

<p>without showing him a Universalist, I would do so; that I am
not trying to bolster up Universalism on Lincoln's faith, as I
do not claim to be a Universalist myself.</p>

<p>There are many points in Mr. Herndon's lecture and letter
that I might notice, but as I am only trying to show that</p>

<p class="c little">HERNDON IS WRONG</p>

<p>in his understanding of Lincoln's religious belief, I shall not
notice them, as they do not concern me or the question in dispute.</p>

<p>Mr. Herndon, in his lecture and letter both, says Mr. Lincoln
wrote a manuscript against Christianity. Mr. Graham,</p>

<p class="c little">LINCOLN'S TEACHER</p>

<p>at the time, testifies that he had the manuscript in his possession
eight to ten days, read it two or three times carefully and it
was in favor of Christianity and universal salvation. Mr. Mostiller
says Lincoln flatly denied infidelity in 1847, and he would
swear to it. Mr. Harnett heard Lincoln on the atonement in
1858. Mr. Cogdal testifies to the same in 1859. The character
of all these men for truth and veracity is as good as any man
in Sangamon or Menard County. Harnett and Mostiller are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
both Methodists, differing politically. Graham and Cogdal are
both Universalists, and agree politically. Mr. Herndon in his
letter says the manuscript was burned by Sam Hill. Mr. Graham
explains it was a letter in regard to a lady,</p>

<p class="c little">MISS ANN RUTLEDGE,</p>

<p>that Hill burned. It seems to me Mr. Herndon has got the
manuscript and letter confounded, and shot off hand without
taking aim at the right object. My friend Herndon, at the
close of his lecture, derives consolation from the fact that a
true history can be written free from the fear of fire and stake.
Friend Herndon, if your life is certainly not in danger some
true spirit will</p>

<p class="c little">DRAG THE TRUTH</p>

<p>out to the light of day.</p>

<p>But hear the closing words of Herndon's lecture; "Now let
it be written in history and on Mr. Lincoln's tomb he died an
unbeliever." Mr. Herndon is in a hurry about it. Be patient,
William; wait for the unfolding of events. The decree has long
since gone out; those words will never be inscribed on</p>

<p class="c little">LINCOLN'S TOMB,</p>

<p>nor written in history. When my friend, W. H. Herndon, dies,
if he wishes a monument on a small scale placed over his grave
with the inscription, "Here lies W. H. Herndon, a man who
in life held that the New Testament Scriptures were no more
inspired than Homer's songs, Milton's Paradise Lost, or Shakspeare,"
or if he desires it, add "Munchausen's Travels," I will
not, for one, object to the inscription. As regards Mr. Herndon's
own belief, he leaves no room for doubt.</p>

grieved to see in it opened afresh that controversy over Lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>coln's
religious views. Being well conversant with the affairs
of the Lincoln family, knowing Mrs. Lincoln personally, having
been in correspondence with that lady, and having also been
of some assistance in a work entitled "Reminiscences of Abraham
Lincoln," I may be permitted to speak with some knowledge
of the facts.</p>

<p>Lincoln, when 16 years of age,</p>

<p class="c little">IN THE BACKWOODS OF WESTERN INDIANA</p>

<p>heard a sermon by a traveling Presbyterian minister&mdash;the Rev.
Dr. Smith&mdash;(afterwards of the First Presbyterian Church of
Springfield, Illinois) then a minister of the Cumberland Presbyterian
Church. The subject was: "Is there no Balm in Gilead?
Is there no Physician there?" The sermon was delivered at
the village of Rockfort, four miles from the small farm of
Thomas Lincoln, Abraham's father. There was a great revival
on that occasion. Always a deep thinker, even when a boy,
Lincoln was seriously impressed. Adopting his own words, he
remembered the sermon for more than twenty years afterwards.
Book after book he then read on the authenticity of the Scriptures,
and was satisfied. Many years after delivering that
sermon Dr. Smith removed to Springfield, Illinois.</p>

<p>This same Dr. Smith, I spent two years with here at Dundee,
and attended him to his death in 1871. He was the bosom
friend of Lincoln, and the friend and dearly beloved pastor of
the Lincoln family.</p>

<p>Some years after Dr. Smith happened on a Sabbath day, in
his church at Springfield, to re-deliver his sermon (delivered,
I think, eighteen years previous). "Is there no Balm in Gilead?
Is there no Physician there?" Lincoln, always a regular attendant,
was there and was much startled. When the congregation
had gone, he sought the preacher. "Dr. Smith," said he,
"was it you who preached that sermon when I was a boy at
Rockfort?" "Yes." "Well," said Mr. Lincoln, "I have never
forgotten that sermon, and never will." I need not narrate
what then passed between them. Sometime after this a discussion
arose in Springfield, as to the credibility of the Scripture.
Knowing Lincoln's well-balanced mind, his studious and deep-thinking
nature and downright honesty, a gentleman, anxious
to have his views, asked if he believed the Scriptures were strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
true. Lincoln answered: "I have investigated that matter thoroughly,
as a lawyer would do, examining testimony, and I hold
that the arguments in favor of the credibility, inspiration, and
Divine authority of the Scripture are unanswerable."</p>

<p>At an annual meeting of the Presbyterian Church of Springfield,
or rather of the Bible Society of that church, Lincoln delivered
a long address on the same subject&mdash;the authenticity of
the Scriptures. An able address it was. His arguments are
too lengthy for me to narrate. For seven years, down to the
day of his departure for Washington to</p>

<p class="c little">ASSUME THE DUTIES OF THE PRESIDENCY,</p>

<p>he was a member of that congregation, and took part and aided
in all benevolent undertakings in connection with the church.
Were I allowed to unfold to the public what is sacred, that
which I know of Mr. Lincoln's inner life during the four years
he was President, his memory would be revered by all Christians
for his entire dependence during that eventful period upon
God's guidance, and not on himself. Truly no man thought
less of himself and of his nothingness without God. This is
exemplified in his public life. When assuming the Presidency,
what did he say? Speaking of the contrast of his time to Washington's:</p>

<p>"I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine Aid
which sustained him [Washington], and on the same Almighty
Being I place my reliance for support. And I hope that you, my
friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance,
without which I cannot succeed, but with which success is
certain."</p>

<p>If an infidel, then is it possible that Abraham Lincoln could
be an honest man as the world knows he was&mdash;and make that
assertion? Is it necessary for me to say more? If so, let me
remind you of his words</p>

<p>(1) To that zealous</p>

<p class="c little">LADY OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMISSION</p>

<p>during the war, in answer to her views of religion:</p>

<p>If what you have told me is really a correct view, I think I
can say with sincerity that I hope I am a Christian.</p>

<p>(2) To the Philadelphia Church Conference in 1864: Allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
me to attest, in response to your address, the accuracy of its
historical statements; indorse the sentiments it expresses, and
thank you in the Nation's name for the sure promise it gives.
God bless the Methodist Church, God bless all the churches, and
blessed be God who giveth us, in this our great trial, churches!</p>

<p>(3) To the Cabinet on the emancipation of the slaves:</p>

<p>"I made a solemn vow before God that if General Lee were
driven from Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by declaring
freedom to the slaves."</p>

<p>(4) On the same subject [slavery] remember he said:
"Whatever appears to be God's will, I will do."</p>

<p class="c little">ONE MORE FINAL PUBLIC ACT</p>

<p>and I am done. At Baltimore he was presented by the negroes
of that city with a copy of the Scriptures. In reply, Lincoln
said:</p>

<p>"In regard to the great Book, I have only to say, it is the best
gift which God has given to man. All the good from the Saviour
of the world is communicated to us through this Book. But for
that Book we could not know right from wrong. All those
things desirable to man are contained in it."</p>

<p>It may appear unnecessary for me to repeat Lincoln's</p>

<p class="c little">PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF RELIGION</p>

<p>in conjunction with what I have issued to the world for the
first time, as to his religious life in private before he was
President, but as my object is to connect his private and public
religious expressions together, and bring them down from the
time he was sixteen years old to his death, and to show that he
was, for these thirty years,</p>

<p class="c little">UNIFORMLY A CHRISTIAN MAN,</p>

<p>you will pardon my repeating in part what the whole world
already knows. Take Lincoln's expressions altogether as above
quoted by me, and I submit you will find not only an absence of
the slightest doubt of religion on his part, but an entire reliance
on God alone for guiding himself and the events of the world.
And yet that foolish man, Herndon, will say&mdash;and I am sorry
to see a small portion of the American press will repeat&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Abraham Lincoln was an Infidel. Marvelous! I am proud to
think I have in my possession&mdash;as a reward for a few insignificant
services done by me on account of Mrs. Lincoln&mdash;the great and
Martyred President's psalm book, which he used while at the
White House, and I shall retain it as a proud memento for my
family, of "Lincoln the Good&mdash;the Saviour of his Country."</p>

<p>A word before I close, as to Mrs. Lincoln. She is a lady
of great merit, and spite of Herndon's mad expression to the
contrary, was dearly loved by the President, as his letters to her
will show, and one does not wonder at it, as her love and regard
for him to this day is even greater than tongue can tell. If the
American people understood Mrs. Lincoln as well as I do, they
would respect her equally as they did Lincoln.</p>

<p class="c little">WHY LINCOLN APPOINTED HIM</p>

<p class="c">Reading (Pa.) <i>News</i></p>

<p>The Rev. James Shrigley who is well known here, was appointed
by President Lincoln a hospital Chaplain during the war.
Pending his confirmation by the United States, a self-constituted
committee of the Young Men's Christian Association called on
the President to protest against the appointment. After Mr.
Shrigley's name had been mentioned the President said: "Oh,
yes, I have sent it to the Senate. His testimonials are highly
satisfactory, and the appointment will, no doubt, be confirmed
at an early day."</p>

<p>The young men replied: "But, sir, we have come not to ask
the appointment, but to solicit you to withdraw the nomination,
on the ground that Mr. Shrigley is not evangelical in his sentiments."
"Ah!" said the President, "that alters the case. On
what point of doctrine is the gentleman unsound?" "He does
not believe in endless punishment," was the reply. "Yes," added
another of the committee, "he believes that even the rebels themselves
will finally be saved, and it will never do to have a man
with such views a hospital Chaplain."</p>

<p>The President hesitated to reply for a moment, and then
responded with an emphasis they will long remember: "If that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
be so, gentlemen, and there be any way under heaven whereby the
rebels can be saved, then for God's sake let the man be appointed!"</p>

<p>He was appointed.</p>

<p class="c">"THE CHRISTIAN'S DEFENCE"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> debate out of which this volume grew was held at Columbus,
Mississippi, in the spring of 1841, between Rev. James Smith
and Mr. C. G. Olmsted. Mr. Olmsted, the author of a work entitled,
"The Bible Its Own Refutation," was a resident of
Columbus. Dr. Smith visited this city during the winter of
1839-1840, and finding the young men of the place to be very
largely under the influence of Mr. Olmsted, he delivered a series
of lectures, especially addressed to the young men of the place,
on "The Natures and Tendencies of Infidelity," and another
upon, "The Evidences of Christianity." While these lectures
were in progress, Dr. Smith was approached by a committee,
who sympathized with Mr. Olmsted's views, and who, with the
sanction of Mr. Olmsted, brought a written challenge to Dr.
Smith to meet Mr. Olmsted in a public discussion of the whole
ground at issue between them. Dr. Smith accepted on condition
that he have time for adequate preparation. He communicated
with friends in Great Britain, who procured and sent
to him the latest and best material bearing on the subject. His
book contains reproductions of the supposed Zodiac at Denderah,
and a colored reproduction from the monuments of Egypt of
brickmakers, believed to be Israelites. The researches of Rawlinson
were made available to him, and a considerable body of
additional literature.</p>

<p>Because Dr. Smith's book has been spoken of slightingly by
men who never saw it and who had the vaguest possible notion
of its content, and because the book itself is so excessively rare
that in the nature of the case few readers of this volume can have
access to it, I have copied the Title Page, a portion of the advertisement,
and the whole of the very full Table of Contents.</p>

<p>We need not concern ourselves with the question whether
Dr. Smith's line of argument is that which probably would be
found most cogent if a similar debate were to be held at the
present day. Sources of information are now available, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
neither Dr. Smith nor his opponent could possibly have had any
knowledge. But any reader of this chapter analysis will be
compelled to testify that a book which covered the ground of
this outline and did it with logical acumen and force of reasoning,
is not to be spoken of now in terms other than those of
admiration for the industry and earnestness of the author, and
the cogency of the conclusions which he deduced from his
premises. One is prepared to believe from the testimony included
in a number of letters that are reprinted in the advertisement and
in the preface that these lectures produced a profound impression
upon those who heard this discussion.</p>

<p>The more carefully these lectures are examined, the more
probable does it appear that in form and method they would
have been likely to make, what they appear to have made, a very
strong impression upon Abraham Lincoln. It must have been
evident to him that Dr. Smith was familiar with both sides of
the question, and Lincoln can but have admired the courage and
ardor with which he went into a discussion so fully in keeping
with methods which Abraham Lincoln himself enjoyed and which
later he employed in his great debate with Douglas. We can
well believe that he spoke with the utmost sincerity when he
told Dr. Smith that he counted the argument unanswerable, and
stated to his brother-in-law, Hon. Ninian W. Edwards, and his
associate at the bar, Mr. Thomas Lewis, that these lectures had
modified his own opinion.</p>


<p class="c">NOTICES OF THE DEBATE WHICH LED TO THE<br />
PUBLISHING OF THE CHRISTIAN'S DEFENCE</p>

<p class="c">From the <i>Southwestern Christian Advocate</i>, Columbus,<br />
Miss., 1841</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>&mdash;I have thought that a concise account of this
debate might not be unacceptable to your readers. It is a mortifying
fact, that this city has become <span class="smcap">FAMOUS</span>&mdash;or rather
<span class="smcap">INFAMOUS</span> for the prevalence of deism and atheism among
her citizens. This has been produced in a good degree by the
efforts of an old gentleman by the name Olmsted. Since his
residence here, which has been for about four years, he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
untiring in his exertions to sow the seeds of moral death in
this community. He has organized his converts into a band,
that operates systematically. He has written a book, which is
not exceeded by <span class="smcap">Tom Paine's</span> <i>Age of Reason</i>, for scurrility
and ridicule. The old gentleman is as artful as the old <span class="smcap">DESTROYER</span>
himself; by which means he has obtained an immense
influence over the minds of the young men of this place.</p>

<p>The circumstances which gave rise to the debate were as
follows: The Rev. James Smith, during a visit in this city, delivered
a few discourses on the dangerous tendencies of infidelity,
addressing himself particularly to the youth. This induced
a committee of infidel gentlemen to address a written challenge
to Mr. S., to meet their champion, Mr. O., in a public
debate. Mr. S. by the advice of many intelligent friends of
truth, accepted the challenge. The time arrived, and the discussion
commenced. All was anxiety and interest. The house
was crowded, even the aisles and windows, with attentive hearers.
They arranged to speak alternately, one, two hours each
night, and the other a half hour; so the debate continued two
hours and a half each night. From the representation of Mr.
O's talents, learning, and preparation, we were made to tremble
for the results; but we were not a little disappointed to find the
old gentleman fall far below his fame....</p>

<p>He asserted that the Jews did not believe in a future state
of existence, until after the Babylonish captivity; that they borrowed
their doctrines of the immortality of the soul from the
nations among whom they were dispersed&mdash;that the Jews believed
in a plurality of gods&mdash;that St. Paul was the author of Christianity&mdash;that
Christianity encourages polygamy. To prove this
last position, he quoted Paul's directions to Timothy: "Let a
bishop be the husband of one wife." And to crown the mass
of absurdities, he endeavored to prove that the blessed Jesus
was a base impostor.</p>

<p>We found Mr. Smith well prepared for the contest. He
had his arguments systematically arranged&mdash;had written them
all, and read them well. He proved to a demonstration, the
<span class="smcap">GENUINENESS</span>, <span class="smcap">AUTHENTICITY</span> and <span class="smcap">INSPIRATION</span> of the Old
Testament Scriptures. His arguments were interesting and
convincing. His arguments on the New Testament were equally
happy, and if possible, more convincing. The conclusion of
every inquirer after truth, must have been, that the champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
of deism was signally defeated, and his cause left bleeding on
the field. I doubt not but the defeat would have been more
complete, had Mr. S. omitted some of his personal allusions, and
had he suppressed his natural inclination to sarcasm. Indeed his
blasts of sarcasm were truly <span class="smcap">WITHERING</span>. His opponent, finding
that he could not cope with him in this respect, retreated, and took
shelter under the sympathies of his audience.</p>

<p class="r">
Yours, &amp;c.,<br />

The precautions of the rulers to prevent the body being
stolen out of the sepulchre. The whole question at issue
between Jesus and the Jewish rulers, suspended on the naked
fact, whether He did or did not rise again on the third
day. The Jewish rulers make their preparation on the
Sabbath to produce the body on the third day. On the
third day the body is missing. Different ways of accounting
for the fact. The disciples alleged that Jesus had
risen from the dead. Their testimony examined. The
Jewish rulers asserted that the disciples stole the body.
The allegation examined. Its falsehood demonstrated.
Subsequent conduct of the Sanhedrin confirms the testimony
of the apostles and evangelists. The adoption of the Jewish
mode of accounting for the fact accompanied with many
difficulties. An acknowledgment of the resurrection of
Jesus involves an acknowledgment of His divine mission.

<p class="c">LINCOLN AND THE CHURCHES</p>

<p class="c">By <span class="smcap">John G. Nicolay and John Hay</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Some of the important material bearing upon Lincoln's religious
convictions which was collected by Nicolay and Hay and published
in the <i>Century Magazine</i>, has, through faulty indexing, been
almost lost. The words "churches" and "religion" are not in the thick
index in the tenth volume of their great work. Finding in the <i>Century
Magazine</i> for August, 1889, an important article on this subject, I searched
in vain for any way of finding it in the book by means of the index,
and two librarians, working in separate libraries, searched for it and
reported to me that it was not in the book. I came to the conclusion
that in the editing of the work for its publication in book form, the two
former secretaries of the President had deemed some of this matter too
personal for their title, "Abraham Lincoln: a History." But I have
discovered the missing passage in the sixth volume, pages 314-342. Its
testimony is in full accord with that subsequently given by Mr. Hay
in the address delivered by him from Mr. Lincoln's old pew, which is
printed in the volume of John Hay's addresses. The article in the
<i>Century</i> is so important that the first and last portions of it will justify
reprinting here. The omitted portions relate to the relations of Mr.
Lincoln and of the Government to particular churches or denominations.</p>

<p class="r">
W. E. B.
</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a conflict which was founded upon the quickened moral sense
of the people it was not strange that the Government received the
most earnest support from the churches. From one end of the
loyal States to the other all the religious organizations, with few
exceptions, moved by the double forces of patriotism and religion,
ranged themselves upon the side of the Government against the
rebellion. A large number of pulpits in the North had already
taken their places as tribunes for the defense of popular freedom,
and it was from them that, at the menace of war, the first cry of
danger and of defiance rang out. Those ministers who had for
years been denouncing the encroachments of slavery did not wait
for any organized action on the part of their colleagues, but proclaimed
at once in a thousand varying tones that peace was "a
blessing worth fighting for." The more conservative churches
were but little in the rear of the more advanced. Those who had
counseled moderation and patience with the South on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the divided responsibility for slavery which rested on both halves
of the nation speedily felt the sense of release front the obligations
of brotherhood when the South had repudiated and renounced
them, and rallied to the support of the insulted flag with
an earnestness not less ardent, and more steadily trustworthy,
than that of the original antislavery clergy. As the war went
on, and as every stage of it gave a clearer presage of the coming
destruction of slavery, the deliverances of the churches became
every day more and more decided in favor of the national cause
and the downfall of human bondage. To detail the thousand
ways in which the churches testified their support of the national
cause, to give even an abstract of the countless expressions of
loyalty which came from the different religious bodies of the
country, would occupy many volumes; we can only refer briefly
to a few of the more important utterances of some of the great
religious societies.</p>

<p>In all the church conventions which met after the President's
preliminary proclamation of the 22d of September, 1862, that
act of liberation was greeted with the heartiest expressions of
approval and support.</p>

<p>As the national authority began to be reëstablished throughout
the States in rebellion, not the least embarrassing of the questions
which generals in command were called upon to decide was that
of the treatment of churches whose pastors were openly or
covertly disloyal to the Union. There was no general plan
adopted by the Government for such cases; in fact, it was impossible
to formulate a policy which should meet so vast a variety
of circumstances as presented themselves in the different regions
of the South. The Board of Missions of the Methodist Church
sent down some of their ablest ministers, with general authority
to take charge of abandoned churches, and to establish in them
their interrupted worship. The mission boards of other denominations
took similar action, and the Secretary of War<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> gave
general orders to the officers commanding the different departments
to permit ministers of the gospel bearing the commission
of these mission boards to exercise the functions of their office
and to give them all the aid, countenance, and support which
might be practicable. But before and after these orders there
was much clashing between the military and the ecclesiastical authorities,
which had its rise generally in the individual tempera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>ments
of the respective generals and priests. There was an instance
in one place where a young officer rose in his pew and
requested an Episcopal minister to read the prayer for the President
of the United States, which he had omitted. Upon the
minister's refusal the soldier advanced to the pulpit and led the
preacher, loudly protesting, to the door, and then quietly returning
to the altar himself read the prayer&mdash;not much, it is to be
feared, to the edification of the congregation. General Butler
arrested a clergyman in Norfolk, and placed him at hard labor
on the public works for disloyalty in belief and action; but the
President reversed this sentence and changed it to one of exclusion
from the Union lines.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The Catholic Bishop of Natchez
having refused to read the prescribed form of prayer for the
President, and having protested in an able and temperate paper
against the orders of the commanding general in this regard, the
latter ordered him to be expelled from the Union lines, although
the order was almost immediately rescinded. General Rosecrans
issued an order<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> in Missouri requiring the members of religious
convocations to give satisfactory evidence of their loyalty to the
Government of the United States as a condition precedent to
their assemblage and protection. In answer to the protestations
which naturally resulted from this mandate he replied that it
was given at the request of many loyal church members, both lay
and clerical; that if he should permit all bodies claiming to be
religious to meet without question, a convocation of Price's
army, under the garb of religion, might assemble with impunity
and plot treason. He claimed that there was no hardship in
compelling the members of such assemblages to establish their
loyalty by oath and certificate, and insisted that his order, while
providing against public danger, really protected the purity and
the freedom of religion.</p>

<p>In the course of these controversies between secessionist ministers
and commanding generals an incident occurred which deserves
a moment's notice, as it led to a clear and vigorous
statement from Mr. Lincoln of his attitude in regard to these
matters. During the year 1862 a somewhat bitter discussion
arose between the Rev. Dr. McPheeters of the Vine Street
Church in St. Louis and some of his congregation in regard to
his supposed sympathies with the rebellion. Looking back upon
the controversy from this distance of time it seems that rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
hard measure was dealt to the parson; for although, from all
the circumstances of the case, there appears little doubt that
his feelings were strongly enlisted in the cause of the rebellion, he
behaved with so much discretion that the principal offenses
charged against him by his zealous parishioners were that he
once baptized a small rebel by the name of Sterling Price, and
that he would not declare himself in favor of the Union. The
difference in his church grew continually more flagrant and was
entertained by interminable letters and statements on both sides,
until at last the provost-marshal intervened, ordering the arrest
of Dr. McPheeters, excluding him from his pulpit, and taking the
control of his church out of the hands of its trustees. This action
gave rise to extended comment, not only in Missouri, but throughout
the Union. The President, being informed of it, wrote<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
to General Curtis disapproving the act of the provost-marshal,
saying, in a terse and vigorous phrase, which immediately obtained
wide currency, "The United States Government must not,
as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an individual
in a church, or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public
interest he must be checked; but let the churches, as such, take
care of themselves." But even this peremptory and unmistakable
command did not put an end to the discussion. Taking
the hands of the Government away from the preacher did not
quench the dissensions in the church, nor restore the pastor to the
position which he occupied before the war; and almost a year
later some of the friends of Dr. McPheeters considered it necessary
and proper to ask the intervention of the President to
restore to him all his ecclesiastical privileges in addition to the
civil rights which they admitted he already enjoyed. This the
President, in a letter<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> of equal clearness and vigor, refused to do.
"I have never interfered," he said, "nor thought of interfering,
as to who shall, or shall not, preach in any church; nor have I
knowingly or believingly tolerated anyone else to so interfere by
my authority"; but he continues, "If, after all, what is now
sought is to have me put Dr. McPheeters back over the heads
of a majority of his own congregation, that too will be declined.
I will not have control of any church on any side." The case
finally ended by the exclusion of Dr. McPheeters from his pulpit
by the order of the presbytery having ecclesiastical authority
in the case.</p>

<p>In this wise and salutary abstention from any interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
with the churches, which was dictated by his own convictions as
well as enjoined by the Constitution, the President did not always
have the support of his subordinates. He had not only, as we
have seen, to administer occasional rebukes to his over-zealous
generals, but even in his own Cabinet he was sometimes compelled
to overrule a disposition to abuse of authority in things
spiritual. Several weeks after he had so clearly expressed himself
in the McPheeters case, he found, to his amazement, that
the Secretary of War had been giving orders virtually placing
the army in certain places at the disposition of a Methodist
bishop for the enforcement of his ecclesiastical decrees. He
addressed to Mr. Stanton a note of measured censure,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
which was followed by an order from the War Department
explaining and modifying the more objectionable features
of the former document. The Secretary explained that his action
had no other intention than to furnish "a means of rallying
the Methodist people in favor of the Union, in localities where
the rebellion had disorganized and scattered them."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This explanation
was not entirely satisfactory to the President, but he
thought best to make no further public reference to the matter.
Scarcely was this affair disposed of when a complaint was received
from Memphis of some interference by the military with
a church edifice there. Mr. Lincoln made upon the paper this
peremptory indorsement: "If the military have military need of
the church building, let them keep it; otherwise, let them get
out of it, and leave it and its owners alone, except for the causes
that justify the arrest of anyone."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Two months later the President,
hearing of further complications in the case, made still
another order, which even at the risk of wearying the reader
we will give, from his own manuscript, as illustrating not only
his conscientious desire that justice should be done, but also the
exasperating obstacles he was continually compelled to surmount,
in those troubled times, to accomplish, with all the vast
powers at his disposition, this reasonable desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am now told that the military were not in possession of
the building; and yet that in pretended execution of the above
they, the military, put one set of men out of and another set into
the building. This, if true, is most extraordinary. I say again,
if there be no military need for the building, leave it alone, neither
putting anyone in or out of it, except on finding someone preaching
or practicing treason, in which case lay hands upon him,
just as if he were doing the same thing in any other building, or
in the streets or highways."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He at last made himself understood and his orders respected;
yet so widespread was the tendency of generals to meddle with
matters beyond their jurisdiction, that it took three years of such
vehement injunctions as these to teach them to keep their hands
away from the clergy and the churches.</p>

<p>Lincoln had a profound respect for every form of sincere
religious belief. He steadily refused to show favor to any particular
denomination of Christians; and when General Grant issued
an unjust and injurious order against the Jews, expelling
them from his department, the President ordered it to be revoked
the moment it was brought to his notice.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>He was a man of profound and intense religious feeling. We
have no purpose of attempting to formulate his creed; we question
if he himself ever did so. There have been swift witnesses
who, judging from expressions uttered in his callow youth, have
called him an atheist, and others who, with the most laudable
intentions, have remembered improbable conversations which
they bring forward to prove at once his orthodoxy and their own
intimacy with him. But leaving aside these apocryphal evidences,
we have only to look at his authentic public and private utterances
to see how deep and strong in all the latter part of his
life was the current of his religious thought and emotion. He
continually invited and appreciated, at their highest value, the
prayers of good people. The pressure of the tremendous problems
by which he was surrounded; the awful moral significance
of the conflict in which he was the chief combatant; the overwhelming
sense of personal responsibility, which never left him
for an hour&mdash;all contributed to produce, in a temperament naturally
serious and predisposed to a spiritual view of life and conduct,
a sense of reverent acceptance of the guidance of a Superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Power. From that morning when, standing amid the falling
snowflakes on the railway car at Springfield, he asked the prayers
of his neighbors in those touching phrases whose echo rose that
night in invocations from thousands of family altars, to that
memorable hour when on the steps of the Capitol he humbled
himself before his Creator in the sublime words of the second
inaugural, there is not an expression known to have come from
his lips or his pen but proves that he held himself answerable
in every act of his career to a more august tribunal than any on
earth. The fact that he was not a communicant of any church,
and that he was singularly reserved in regard to his personal
religious life, gives only the greater force to these striking proofs
of his profound reverence and faith.</p>

<p>In final substantiation of this assertion, we subjoin two papers
from the hand of the President, one official and the other private,
which bear within themselves the imprint of a sincere devotion
and a steadfast reliance upon the power and benignity of an overruling
Providence. The first is an order which he issued on the
16th of November, 1864, on the observance of Sunday:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and
Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath
by the officers and men in the military and naval service. The
importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly rest, the
sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference
to the best sentiment of Christian people, and a due regard
for the Divine will, demand that Sunday labor in the Army and
Navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity. The discipline
and character of the national forces should not suffer,
nor the cause they defend be imperiled, by the profanation of the
day or name of the Most High. 'At this time of public distress
[adopting the words of Washington in 1776] men may find
enough to do in the service of their God and their country without
abandoning themselves to vice and immorality.' The first General
Order issued by the Father of his Country after the Declaration
of Independence indicated the spirit in which our institutions
were founded and should ever be defended. 'The General hopes
and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and
act as becomes a Christian soldier, defending the dearest rights
and liberties of his country.'"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>The date of this remarkable order leaves no possibility for
the insinuation that it sprung from any political purpose, or intention.
Mr. Lincoln had just been re-elected by an overwhelming
majority; his party was everywhere triumphant; his own personal
popularity was unbounded; there was no temptation to
hypocrisy or deceit. There is no explanation of the order except
that it was the offspring of sincere conviction. But if it may
be said that this was, after all, an exoteric utterance, springing
from those relations of religion and good government which the
wisest rulers have always recognized in their intercourse with
the people, we will give one other document, of which nothing
of the sort can be said. It is a paper which Mr. Lincoln wrote
in September, 1862, while his mind was burdened with the
weightiest question of his life, the weightiest with which this
century has had to grapple. Wearied with all the considerations
of law and of expediency with which he had been struggling
for two years, he retired within himself and tried to bring some
order into his thoughts by rising above the wrangling of men and
of parties, and pondering the relations of human government to
the Divine. In this frame of mind, absolutely detached from any
earthly considerations, he wrote this meditation. It has never
been published. It was not written to be seen of men. It was
penned in the awful sincerity of a perfectly honest soul trying to
bring itself into closer communion with its Maker.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The will of God prevails. In great contests each party
claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both <i>may</i> be
and one <i>must</i> be wrong. God cannot be <i>for</i> and <i>against</i> the
same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite
possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose
of either party; and yet the human instrumentalities, working
just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect His purpose.
I am almost ready to say that this is probably true; that
God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By
His mere great power on the minds of the now contestants, He
could have either <i>saved</i> or <i>destroyed</i> the Union without a human
contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, he could give
the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>The following brief address by Mr. Lincoln appears never to have
been published. It was discovered, just as this book was going to press,
by Mr. Jesse W. Weik, who hastened to send it to me. It is the shorthand
report of a brief address delivered by Mr. Lincoln at a railroad
junction near La Fayette, Indiana, a few hours after he had left Springfield
on his way to Washington, Saturday, February 11, 1860.</p>

<p class="r">
W. H. B.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I first came to the west some forty-four or forty-five
years ago, at sundown you had completed a journey of some
thirty miles, which you had commenced at sunrise; and you
thought you had done well. Now, only six hours have elapsed
since I left my home in Illinois, where I was surrounded by a
large concourse of my fellow citizens, most all of whom I could
recognize; and I find myself far from home, surrounded by the
thousands I now see before me, who are strangers to me. Still
we are bound together, I trust, in Christianity, civilization and
patriotism, and are attached to our country and our whole country.
While some of us may differ in political opinions, still we
are all united in one feeling for the Union.</p></blockquote>

<p class="medium">(The bibliographical notes which the author made while this work
was in preparation reached a total of several thousand. From these he
at first selected about five hundred titles, being practically a catalogue
of his own Lincoln library, a list of books about Lincoln which he
considered worth buying. But this also appeared much longer than was
needed for the purposes of this book, and he has therefore prepared
this shorter list of books bearing more directly upon the subject matter
of this volume, and for the convenience of such readers as are unfamiliar
with the literature of the subject he has added comments upon some
of the books or articles.)</p>

<p class="medium">There is a larger edition in twelve volumes, with some additions, and
there are two other notable collections, both of them good. No one of
these, however, is entirely complete; and there are volumes such as "The

Mifflin &amp; Co., 1917) which supplement the "complete" works. Very
nearly everything which the reader requires, however, is in the Nicolay

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> All the quotations in this book from Herndon's <i>Lincoln</i> are from
the first edition in three volumes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The habit of studying aloud, learned in the "blab-school," remained
with him. Lamon says he read aloud and "couldn't read otherwise."
Whitney tells of his writing a ruling one time when he was
sitting (illegally) for Judge Davis, and he pronounced each word aloud
as he wrote it. This was not his invariable custom, but it was a common
one with him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Hodgenville was a Baptist settlement from its foundation. Robert
Hodgen, for whom the settlement was named, and John Larue, his
brother-in-law, for whom the county was named, were both Baptists,
and among the first settlers was a Baptist minister, Rev. Benjamin Lyon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Baptisms of this noisy character were familiar to Lincoln in his
boyhood and certainly as late as the period of his residence in New
Salem. Henry Onstott, at whose tavern Lincoln boarded, tells of such
baptisms performed by Rev. Abraham Bale, including one at which the
husband of the lady who was being baptized called out to the preacher
to hold her, as he valued her more highly than the best cow and calf in
the county (<i>Lincoln and Salem</i>, p. 122).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> While the statements of Dennis Hanks are often colored by his
imagination, he is, after all, our best witness concerning Lincoln's boyhood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Some writers have spoken of Mr. Elkin as a Methodist circuit
rider. Mrs. Lucinda Boyd, in a book which might better not have been
published and which I will not name, but which is correct in some local
matters, speaks of Rev. Robert Elkin, the minister who preached the
funeral sermon of Mrs. Lincoln, as belonging to the "Traveling Baptist
Church." She says: "His grave is in the open field, and soon the traces
of it will be lost." Apparently this grave was in Clark County, Kentucky.
I think, however, that she is in error as to the name Robert. It
was David.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The latest writer to lend to the incident of Nancy Lincoln's funeral
the aid of a vivid imagination and a versatile pen is Rose Strunsky.
Discarding the theory that Abraham wrote his first letter to invite a minister
to come from Kentucky to preach his mother's funeral, she sends
him on foot to a nearer settlement:
</p>
<p>
"The boy Abraham had his standards of life. There were things of
too much meaning to let pass without some gesture. And the unceremonious
burial in the forest haunted him. When he heard that a wandering
preacher had reached the neighborhood, he tramped many miles
in the snow to bring him to the spot where the dead body lay, so that
a funeral sermon might be delivered over the now white grave" (<i>Abraham
Lincoln</i>, p. 6).
</p>
<p>
There was nothing unusual about the burial. Nor was there anything
unusual about the deferred funeral. These writers simply do not know
the conditions of life in which the boy Lincoln lived.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> While this manuscript was in process of writing, Professor Raymond,
of Berea College, Kentucky, enumerating his summer engagements
for the season of 1919, informed me of a funeral he was engaged to
preach in August of a boy who died ten years ago. The boy's companions
have by this time grown to manhood, but the service will be
held: and before this book is published doubtless will have been held
according to immemorial custom in that region. This is not because
there has been no preacher in its vicinity within ten years; nor is there
any reason to suppose that the delay in the case of Lincoln's mother
was due to the utter absence of ministers. They were not abundant, certainly;
but there is no reason whatever to suppose that in the interval
between the death and funeral of Nancy Hanks no preacher had been
in the neighborhood of Pigeon Creek.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> I have often been deeply impressed by the charity of primitive
preachers for dead people, and their ingenuity in inventing possible
opportunities for repentance where no outward sign was given or apparently
possible. There was something impressive in their manner of
doing it, as well as an exhibition of fine tenderness for the feelings of
friends and of generosity toward the dead.

is a very precious article of faith in the creed of men who have to preach

first edition stand. It ought not to have included these vulgarities; but
they are not so bad as the impression which is created by the knowledge
that a new edition had to be made on their account. They are coarse
bits of rustic buffoonery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> I do not forget that Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were
married by Rev. Jesse Head, who was a Methodist preacher. But I do
not find evidence that Mr. Head exerted any marked influence over them.
Mr. Head was not only a minister, but a justice of the peace, an anti-slavery
man, and a person of strong and righteous character. I am not
sure whether the fact that he performed this marriage is not due in
some measure to the fact that he was about the court house, and a
convenient minister to find.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Dr. Chapman goes even beyond Johnson in his admiration of
these youthful lines. He says:
</p>
<p>
"It is profoundly significant that this child of destiny, at his life's
early morning, in clumsy but impressive verse thus reverently coupled
his name with that of his Creator.... I am not claiming for this
fragment of a Lincoln manuscript any divine inspiration" (<i>Latest Light
on Lincoln</i>, p. 315).
</p>
<p>
But he stops little short of that, and might about as well have
claimed it. The simple truth is that the lines have no significance whatever.
They were a current bit of schoolboy doggerel, not original with
Lincoln, and were scribbled by him as by other boys, with no real purpose
beyond that of working his name into a jingle.</p></div>

related in after life. It is found in several collections of his stories, and
with some variation. The Indian himself has found a place in literature
in "In the Boyhood of Lincoln" by my friend, now deceased, Hezekiah
Butterworth. The epitaph more nearly in its ancient English form is
found in "David Elginbrod," by George Macdonald:

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The story of Lincoln's love affairs lies mostly outside the field
of our present inquiry. He had at least one more of them than his
biographers have learned about. Those that are best known are the ones
with Ann Rutledge, Mary Owens, and Mary Todd. Lamon declares that
Lincoln loved Miss Matilda Edwards, sister of Ninian W. Edwards,
whose wife was sister to Mary Todd. He gives this as the real reason
for the estrangement of Lincoln and his fiancée (Lamon's <i>Life of Lincoln</i>,
p. 259). This is vigorously denied by members of the Edwards
family, and the opinions in Springfield are anything but unanimous.
Herndon informs us that in 1840, when Lincoln was thirty-one, and
during the period when he was attracted to Mary Todd, he proposed to
Sarah Rickard, a girl of sixteen. The present writer has no occasion
to go into the discussions attending these several affairs of the heart.
Lincoln's unsettled condition of mind on matrimonial and other matters
is, however, an important element in any study of his religious life in
this period. Herndon, between whom and Mrs. Lincoln little love was
lost, was not unwilling to inform her and the world that Lincoln had
loved one woman, at least, more than he ever loved her; and that he
married her reluctantly. This was not pleasant information for a proud
and erratic grief-stricken woman, and it is not certain that Herndon
was impartial authority or that he learned the whole truth. Lincoln was
not a lady's man, and Mary Owens was quite right in deeming him
"deficient in those little links that make up the chain of a woman's
happiness."
</p>
<p>
Students of the Lincoln material are informed by those who suppose
themselves to know, that beside the above-mentioned adventures, Lincoln
had at least one additional love affair, and one that was not to his credit.
They are told that the proof of this exists in an unpublished letter from
the hand of Lincoln, a letter sacredly guarded and seldom shown by its
owner. If this book had any reason to go at length into the subject of
Lincoln's love affairs, I should be glad to consider that matter in detail;
for the owner of that letter has permitted me to read and copy it, and
I have the copy, which I intend to use in another volume on Lincoln.
I wish to say, however, that the letter, which is a free, unguarded note
to an intimate friend, does not sustain the impression that Lincoln had
any other love affair, or that any wrong act or motive lay behind his
words. Lincoln was not a tactful man in his relations with women; but
he was a clean man.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> "Mr. Lincoln was never agitated by any passion more than by his
wonderful thirst for distinction. There is no instance where an important
office was within his reach, and he did not try to get it" (Lamon, <i>Life
of Lincoln</i>, p. 237). This is a harsh and unfriendly way of stating it, but
it is not wholly false.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Mr. John E. Burton has documentary evidence that Lincoln was
associated as so-called partner with seven law firms. Mr. Burton has
owned the firm signatures in Lincoln's handwriting as follows:
</p>

<ul><li>Stuart and Lincoln 1838</li>
<li>Ficklin and Lincoln 1842</li>
<li>Logan and Lincoln 1845</li>
<li>Harlan and Lincoln 1845</li>
<li>Goodrich and Lincoln October 1855</li>
<li>Lincoln and Herndon 1852</li>
<li>Lincoln and Lamon</li></ul>


<p>
But these associates, except Stuart, Logan, and Herndon, were not
strictly partnerships. They were local associations with lawyers whose
practice he shared.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Mr. Barker, the bookseller and publisher of Springfield, has or
had an interesting item in a volume which Mr. Lincoln presented to
Rev. William A. Chapin, a returned missionary, who lived with the
family of his relative, Albert Hale. Mr. Lincoln was on close terms
with "Father Hale" and a friend of Mr. Chapin. The book is one
volume, the others being lost, of a set entitled "<i>Horae Solitariae, or,
Essays on Some Remarkable Names and Titles of the Holy Spirit.</i>
First American from the Second London Edition. Philadelphia: Cochran
&amp; McLoughlan, 1801." The book bears no name of author. Upon the
flyleaf is the autograph of Mr. Chapin in these words, "William A.
Chapin, 1844. A present from Abr. Lincoln." How Lincoln obtained the
book is not known; nor is it one for which he would have been likely
to care. But he cared enough for the book or for the missionary or for
both to present the one to the other. His aversion to ministers, which
Lamon portrays, may have had some reason in certain cases; but it was
not inclusive of all ministers nor of ministers as a class.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> I have been at much trouble to get the exact name and dates of
this little boy. He was called Eddie, and the name is sometimes given
Edwin and sometimes Edward, and I did not find it easy to learn, even
at the monument at Springfield, the exact date of his death. He was
named for his father's friend, and associate in the Legislature, Edward
Baker. He was born March 10, 1846, and died February 1, 1850. Lincoln's
children were: Robert Todd, born August 1, 1843, still living;
Edward Baker, born March 10, 1846, died in Springfield February 1,
1850; William Wallace, born December 21, 1850, died in the White House
February 20, 1862; Thomas or "Tad," born April 4, 1853; died in Chicago,
July 15, 1871. Mary Todd Lincoln, their mother, was born in Lexington,
Kentucky, December 13, 1818; married Abraham Lincoln, November 4,
1842, and died in Springfield July 16, 1882.
</p>
<p>
The date of the death of Eddie is important, because it gives us
a <i>terminus a quem</i> for Lincoln's acquaintance with Rev. James Smith.
Dr. Smith gives the date as "in the latter part of 1849." I sought in
vain not only in published Lives of Lincoln but in the material on file
with the State Historical Society for the precise date. What is more
surprising, Colonel Johnson, custodian of the Lincoln tomb, has made
diligent search for me and cannot find the date. In an article, prepared
for the Lincoln Centenary in 1909, Rev. Thomas D. Logan, D.D., then
pastor of the church in Springfield which Lincoln attended and successor
of Dr. Smith, said it was "about 1848 or 1849"; but in working over
the material, as he manifestly did, after furnishing it to <i>The Interior</i>,
in which it was printed, and delivering the substance of it as a centenary
address, he gives the date as February 1, 1850. This I judge to be correct,
and it is upon his authority I have given that date above. The other dates
of the Lincoln family's relation to this church support this statement.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Newton Bateman was born at Fairfield, New York, July 27, 1822,
and migrated with his parents to Illinois in his boyhood. He was graduated
from Illinois College, in Jacksonville, in 1843, and was honored
as one of the ablest men in the alumni of that institution. He first knew
Abraham Lincoln in 1847, and knew him with increasing intimacy during
the years of 1859 and 1860 when Mr. Bateman was in Springfield. Mr.
Bateman served as Superintendent of Schools of the State of Illinois
continuously from 1859 to 1875, except for the single term 1863-65.
During his administration the school system of Illinois made notable
progress, and he is remembered as having done large things for the
educational system of his State. He was the author of the plan for
the education of all the children of all the people of the State at the
expense of all the property of the State. He wrought his system into
the new constitution of Illinois, adopted in 1871, while he was at the
zenith of his power. He was repeatedly re-elected, his defeat in 1862
being a defeat shared with the whole Republican ticket of the State
in an off-year election when nearly the whole North, weary of the war
which had scarcely begun, defeated partly by hostility and partly by
lethargy the party and the policies that had sent Lincoln to the White
House; and Bateman was triumphantly re-elected when Lincoln was
re-elected, and for many terms thereafter. He established the Normal
School system of the State; and his work was monumental in the life
of the State University. Few men deserve so well to be remembered
with honor in Illinois.
</p>
<p>
At the close of his long term of service as Superintendent of
Schools, he became President of Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois, from
1875 to 1893. He was small in stature, and by his friends was familiarly
called "Little Newt," but was held in high regard as a man of honor
and an educator of note. Besides his published reports and addresses,
he compiled a large encyclopedia of men of Illinois,&mdash;a kind of "Who's
Who" of much value. His family at one time proposed to gather and
issue a memorial volume of his addresses, but the plan appears not to
have been carried out. He died of angina pectoris at Galesburg, October
21, 1897.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> It is now known that it was through the influence of Robert
Chambers that T. H. Huxley was present and made his famous reply
to Bishop Wilberforce at Oxford in 1860. Huxley was in Oxford, but
intended to have left that morning because he believed that the discussion
would take a theological, or other than a scientific turn, and would be
unprofitable, but "on the Friday afternoon he chanced to meet Robert
Chambers, the reputed author of the <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>, who begged
him not to desert them, accordingly he postponed his departure" (<i>Life
and Letters of Thomas H. Huxley</i>, by his Son, I, 193). In this discussion
Bishop Wilberforce, in closing a half-hour's clever, but unfair
speech, turned to Huxley and asked him whether it was on the side of
Huxley's grandfather or grandmother that he claimed his own descent
from a monkey? Huxley endured the laughter and applause which followed
this personal sally with something more than good nature. He
turned to Sir Benjamin Brodie, who sat beside him, and slapping his
knee, exclaimed: "The Lord hath delivered him into my hands!" It
was even so. Huxley rose to reply, and said that he would not be
ashamed of having a monkey as an ancestor, but he would be ashamed
of any relationship to a gifted man, who, not content with success in his
own sphere of activity, plunged into a discussion of matters of which
he had no real acquaintance "only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric,
and distract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by
eloquent digressions, and skilled appeals to religious prejudice."
</p>
<p>
In its way that speech established the popularity of Huxley as a
debator, and effectually punctured one argument then coming into use
in the discussion of evolution. It also was an incident never forgotten
concerning Bishop Wilberforce. Huxley afterward wrote, "In justice
to the Bishop, I am bound to say he bore me no malice, but was always
courtesy itself when we met in after years." In the same letter Huxley
says, "The odd part of the business is, that I should not have been
present except for Robert Chambers."</p></div>

the opinion that the inscription from Professor Anthon is not genuine.
He thinks it may have been added by Dr. English, not with intent to

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> This book had been written and was in course of revision when
I procured Dr. Chapman's <i>Latest Light on Lincoln</i>. It is a book by one
who loved Lincoln sincerely, and can discover in him no lack of any
desirable quality; even physical beauty and grace of movement are here
attributed to Lincoln, as well as the acceptance of all the fundamental
articles of the creeds. He accepts the Beecher incident, declaring that
Dr. Johnson informed him that "after thorough investigation he fully
believed it to be truthful and authentic," and affirming that "upon the
scene of this unique event there rests a halo of celestial beauty too sacred
to be regarded with indifference or doubt." The halo may be there, but
is it true? Was there any period of twenty-four hours while Lincoln
was in the White House when this could have occurred, and the fact
concealed from the public? It is altogether less improbable that Mrs.
Beecher in her extreme old age and failing mentality was mistaken about
the identity of one of Mr. Beecher's callers.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> This incident must have appeared in print immediately after Lincoln's
death, for I find it quoted in memorial addresses of May, 1865.
Mr. Oldroyd has endeavored to learn for me in what paper he found it
and on whose authority it rests, but without result. He does not remember
where he found it. It is inherently improbable, and rests on
no adequate testimony. It ought to be wholly disregarded. The earliest
reference I have found to the story in which Lincoln is alleged to have
said to an unnamed Illinois minister "I do love Jesus" is in a sermon
preached in the Baptist Church of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, April 19, 1865,
by Rev. W. W. Whitcomb, which was published in the Oshkosh <i>Northwestern</i>,
April 21, 1865, and in 1907 issued in pamphlet form, by John E.
Burton. The form of quotation is indefinite, but I judge that the incident
was current in the papers of that week, as it is quoted as something
with which the congregation was assumed to be familiar. I judge,
therefore, that this was a story that found currency immediately after
Lincoln's death, running the round of the newspapers with no one's
name attached.</p></div>

prefixing "Mr." A few he called by their first name. Herndon he called
"Billy." Ward Hill Lamon he addressed as "Hill." Some of his friends
called him "Lincoln," but most of them, "Mr. Lincoln." If any habitually
addressed him as "Abe," the author has been unable to learn the
fact.
</p>
<p>
"Although I have heard of cheap fellows, professing that they were
wont to address him as 'Abe,' I never knew any one who did it in his

called 'Abe'." <span class="smcap">Whitney</span>: <i>Life on the Circuit with Lincoln</i>, p. 53.</p></div>

of Lincoln's orthodoxy to escape him, records this incident with complete
assurance of its correctness; but it is a story which it is impossible
to fit into the life of Lincoln.
</p>
<p>
In <i>Latest Light on Lincoln</i>, p. 396, Chapman says, "There is every
reason for giving this remarkable story unquestioning credence." On
the contrary, there is every good reason for questioning it at every essential
point, and the questions do not evoke satisfactory answers.</p></div>

<p>"One of the most obvious of Mr. Lincoln's peculiarities was his
dissimilitude of qualities, or inequality of conduct, his dignity of deportment
and action, interspersed with freaks of frivolity and inanity; his
high aspiration and achievement, and his descent into the most primitive
vales of listlessness, and the most ridiculous buffoonery. He combined
the consideration of the movement of armies or grave questions of
international concern, with Nasby's feeble jokes or Dan Rice's clownish
tricks. In the chief drawer of his cabinet table, all the current joke books
of the time were in juxtaposition with official commissions lacking only
his final signature, applications for pardons from death penalties, laws
awaiting executive action, and orders, which, when issued, would control
the fate of a million men and the destinies of unborn generations....
Hence it was that superficial persons, who expected great achievements
to be set in a <i>mise en scéne</i>, and to be ushered in with a prologue, could
not understand or appreciate that this wonderful man's administration
was a succession of acts of grand and heroic statesmanship, or that he

put to a severe test in 1864, when the convention that renominated him

Hamlin. Lincoln liked Hamlin; but, while a Vice-President from
Maine had strengthened the ticket in 1860, a war Democrat from one of
the border States could help it more in 1864. Lincoln managed never to
let it be known whether he favored Hamlin, who greatly desired his
support, or whether, as was probably the case, he preferred Johnson.
He was skillful in evasion when he chose to be so.</p></div>

<p>"By reference to Mr. Lincoln's early political and literary performances
it will appear that he was more than usually addicted to a
florid style, and to greatly exaggerated figures of speech; that the plain,
direct, homely, common-sense methods of his later and statesmanlike
years were wholly wanting. Rhodomontade was as common in those
youthful productions as plain assertion was in his mature life. It is
not, therefore, to be wondered at that, in the years of his adolescence,
he is credited with very decided opinions, radical views, and florid expressions
on the subject of religion; but he was forty-five years of age
when I first knew him, and his views either underwent a change or else
he had grown reticent on that great subject. Certain it is that I never

<p><a name="Footnote_69_69" id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> Dr. Chapman, who is not content with anything less than a complete
orthodox system of theology for Lincoln, says:
</p>
<p>
"In the forefront of Mr. Lincoln's religious thinking was his belief
in the Saviour's Deity." His first, and in fact his only proof, is, of course,
the Bateman interview. Beyond this he falls into such generalities as
his oft repeated mention of Him as "Our Lord," and declares that
"again and again does Mr. Lincoln thus speak of the Saviour" (<i>Latest
Light on Lincoln</i>, p. 319). If so, I have not found these repeated references
in his authentic speeches and papers.</p></div>

Niagara Falls; and there are a few other references.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> Dr. Chapman's <i>Latest Light on Lincoln</i> has a few hitherto unprinted
things, one of them being some notes by Rev. Dr. Gurley, the beginnings
of a contemplated book or pamphlet which he did not complete. The
manuscript as produced by Dr. Chapman was furnished by Dr. Gurley's
daughter, Mrs. Emma K. Adams, of Washington. The only incident of
any considerable value is that Mr. Lincoln one night invited Dr. Gurley,
who like himself was an early riser, to come to the White House next
morning at seven o'clock for an hour's talk before breakfast. They had
the talk and the breakfast. As Dr. Gurley walked away, he was asked
whether he and Mr. Lincoln had been talking about the war, and he
replied, "Far from it. We have been talking about the state of the
soul after death. That is a subject of which Mr. Lincoln never tires.
This morning, however, I was a listener, as Mr. Lincoln did all the
talking" (<i>Latest Light on Lincoln</i>, p. 500).

<p>
There can be, I think, no serious question of Mr. Lincoln's faith in
immortality. It was much more easy for a man of his training and
temperament to hold that article of faith than some others which might
seem to some other men more easily to be accepted.</p></div>

pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, in Springfield, Ill.), as a lecture,
and has been repeatedly given in that form to various audiences. At the
request of the editor of <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>, to whom it seemed that the
testimony contained in the lecture was of permanent value, it is here
presented with slight alterations, and with no departure from the rhetorical
style which was determined by its original purpose.</p></div>

be June 16, 1858, instead of January. I have printed it as it stands, but
the date should be corrected.</p></div>

you can conceive of my embarrassment at now having brought to me
what purported to be a formal order of the War Department, bearing
date November 30, 1863, giving Bishop Ames control and possession of
all the Methodist churches in certain Southern military departments
whose pastors have not been appointed by a loyal bishop or bishops, and
ordering the military to aid him against any resistance which may be
made to his taking such possession and control. What is to be done
about it?" [Lincoln to Stanton, MS., Feb. 11, 1864.]</p></div>

Sabbatarian feeling. The President had ordered a movement
which required dispatch, and in his anxiety rode to McDowell's headquarters
to inquire how soon he could start. "On Monday morning,"
said McDowell; "or, by pushing things, perhaps Sunday afternoon."
Lincoln, after a moment's thought, said, "McDowell, get a good ready
and start Monday." [Herman Haupt, MS. Memoirs.]</p></div></div>
